<p class="noindents">Most of the chapters in the book focus on analyzing sentence structures to identify patterns in word sequences using spaCy. To understand sentence analysis and patterns, you need some basic knowledge of linguistics. This appendix contains a linguistic primer to use as a reference.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev173"><strong>Dependency Grammars vs. Phrase Structure Grammars</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">By default, spaCy uses a dependency grammar rather than a phrase structure grammar more commonly used in linguistics. This section explains the difference between these two grammar types. If you have a formal linguistic background, you may find this information helpful.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Also known as a constituent-based grammar, a <em>phrase structure grammar</em> models natural language based on how words combine to form constituents in a sentence. In syntax, a <em>constituent</em> is a group of words that functions as a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_186"/>single unit in a sentence. The phrase structure rules decompose a sentence into its constituent parts, forming a tree structure that begins with individual words and builds up larger and larger constituents.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In contrast, a <em>dependency grammar</em> is a word-based grammar that focuses on the relations between individual words rather than between constituents. As a result, a dependency parse, like the ones shown throughout this book, forms a tree that reflects how words relate to other words in a sentence.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><a href="../Text/app01.xhtml#app01fig01">Figure A-1</a> shows an example of a sentence parsing using both grammar types.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="app01fig01"/><img src="../Images/app1-1.jpg" alt="image" width="637" height="372"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-1: An example of tree structures for a constituent-based phrase structure grammar (left) and a word-based dependency grammar (right)</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The phrase structure tree breaks up the sentence based on the fact that the sentence consists of a noun phrase and a verb phrase. Those phrases appear on the second level of the hierarchy, directly under the sentence (S) mark—the formal top level. On the bottom level are the individual words that make up those phrases.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In contrast, the dependency structure uses the verb as the structural center of a sentence. The other words are either directly or indirectly connected to this verb with the help of directed links, known as <em>dependencies</em>. The dependency grammar that spaCy uses by default expresses the grammatical structure of a sentence as a set of one-to-one correspondences between words.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each of these relations represents a grammatical function in which one word is the <em>child</em>, or the dependent word, and the other is the <em>head</em>, or the governor. For example, in the pair “blue sky,” the dominant word is “sky,” and “blue”—its modifier—is its subordinate. You can think of the head as the word with the most relative “importance” and without which the child doesn’t make sense. By contrast, the head of a relation can often stand in a sentence without the child (for example, you don’t need “African” or “wild” in the sentence shown in <a href="../Text/app01.xhtml#app01fig01">Figure A-1</a>, nor “quickly”).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_187"/><a href="../Text/app01.xhtml#app01fig02">Figure A-2</a> shows a graphical depiction of this concept.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="app01fig02"/><img src="../Images/app1-2.jpg" alt="image" width="411" height="163"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure A-2: An example of a dependency tree structure based on the head/child concept</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that the dependency tree shown in <a href="../Text/app01.xhtml#app01fig02">Figure A-2</a> is similar to the representation on the right in <a href="../Text/app01.xhtml#app01fig01">Figure A-1</a>. The only difference between these two representations is a visual one: although the tree shown in <a href="../Text/app01.xhtml#app01fig01">Figure A-1</a> has a pyramidal view, the tree in <a href="../Text/app01.xhtml#app01fig02">Figure A-2</a> uses labeled, directed arcs to emphasize the head/child link.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each word in a sentence must be connected to exactly one head. But the same word might have none, one, or several children. The spaCy grammar assumes that the head of a sentence (the <span class="literal">ROOT</span> token) is its own head. In this example, the verb “run” is the head of the sentence, so the <span class="literal">head</span> property of the Token object representing this word will refer to this same Token object.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Note that the head/child relationship has nothing to do with linear order in the sentence. For example, the child “wild” comes before its head “animals,” but the child “quickly” comes after its head “run.”</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev174"><strong>Common Grammar Concepts</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This section discusses the more advanced grammar concepts used in the book, including transitive verbs and direct objects, prepositional objects, modal auxiliary verbs, and personal pronouns.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev175"><strong><em>Transitive Verbs and Direct Objects</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>direct object</em> is a noun (or a noun phrase) denoting something that is directly acted on by a verb. A <em>transitive verb</em> accepts a direct object. In most cases, for identifying intent, the transitive verb and its direct object are the most important words in a sentence to extract. The reason is that these words typically best describe the action and the thing acted upon. For example, in the sentence, “I want a pizza,” the words “want” and “pizza” express the sentence’s intent.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev176"><strong><em>Prepositional Objects</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>preposition</em> connects noun phrases with other words in a sentence. Prepositions such as “in,” “above,” “under,” “after,” and “before” express spatial or temporal relations. Others, such as “to,” “of,” and “for,” indicate semantic roles. For instance, in the sentence, “You’ll find the envelope under the book,” the preposition “under” expresses a spatial relationship <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_188"/>between the envelope and the book. And in the sentence, “I will deploy it to a channel,” the use of the preposition “to” indicates the role goal expressed by the prepositional phrase “a channel.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">An <em>object of a preposition</em> (known as a complement in theoretical linguistics) is a noun, pronoun, or noun phrase that follows a preposition. In the sentence, “I wrote a series of articles,” the word “articles” is the object of the preposition.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In some questions, extracting the object of the preposition might give you the most informative word or phrase in terms of finding the answer, as shown in the question, “What can be done about climate change?” The phrase “climate change” is the key phrase in determining what the question is about.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The spaCy dependency parser indexes prepositions as <span class="literal">'prep'</span> and objects of the preposition as <span class="literal">'pobj'</span>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev177"><strong><em>Modal Auxiliary Verbs</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Modal auxiliary verbs include “may,” “might,” “can,” “could,” “must,” “ought,” “shall,” “should,” “will,” and “would,” among others. They’re used in conjunction with a main verb in the base form to indicate <em>modality</em>—in other words, likelihood, permission, capability, necessity, willingness, or advice.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The spaCy part-of-speech tagger recognizes modal auxiliary verbs, marking them with the fine-grained part-of-speech tag <span class="literal">'MD'</span>. The syntactic dependency parser marks them as <span class="literal">'aux'</span>. You might need to check whether a sentence uses a modal auxiliary verb when you need, for example, to reconstruct the sentence from a question.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev178"><strong><em>Personal Pronouns</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A personal pronoun refers to a specific person, object, or to multiple people or objects. In English, personal pronouns have a number of forms, distinguished according to their grammatical role in a sentence:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The nominative form (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) is typically used as the nominal subject of a verb.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The accusative form (me, you, him, her, it, us, them) is typically used as the object of a verb or preposition.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">The reflexive form (myself, yourself/yourselves, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, themselves) typically refers back to the subject specified within the same clause.</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">The spaCy parser assigns different dependency labels to personal pronouns according to their forms. Thus, a personal pronoun in nominative form is usually assigned the <span class="literal">'nsubj'</span> dependency label, which stands for “nominal subject.” It is interesting to note that in many user-generated sentences for chatbots, the subject of the sentence is “I.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In accusative form, a personal pronoun can be assigned either <span class="literal">'dobj'</span> or <span class="literal">'iobj'</span>, which stands for direct object and indirect object, respectively. Reflexive pronouns also usually act as either direct objects or indirect objects.</p>&#13;
