			<p class="ChapterIntro">When learning a new programming language, it’s a long-standing tradition that the first code you write is to display the message ‘Hello, World!’ In keeping with that tradition, you’ll do that here too—but that’s not all. This chapter introduces everything you need to understand the fundamentals of Processing, and you’ll quickly move on from a simple ‘Hello, World!’ to drawing with code.</p>
			<p>To get started, you’ll set up Python Mode for Processing so you can create your own sketches. Along the way, you’ll learn the basic rules of writing code in Processing, as well as how to deal with errors, use variables, and perform arithmetic operations. You’ll also learn about how Processing handles color and how to measure angles using radians. By the end of this chapter, you’ll be comfortable drawing colorful geometric shapes by using various Processing functions. Let’s get started.</p>

			<p class="BodyFirst">Before writing any code, you first need to set up Python Mode for Processing. Head over to the Processing downloads web page (<a class="LinkURL" href="https://processing.org/download/">https://processing.org/download/</a>) and grab the version of Processing appropriate for your system (Windows, Linux, or macOS). As of January 2021, Processing 3.5.4 is the latest stable release.</p>
			<p>
				Processing does not employ an installation program. Instead, you simply extract the file you have downloaded (usually a <em>.zip</em> archive) and run the application. The exact process varies slightly between operating systems:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					On Windows, unzip all of the contents by right-clicking the file and selecting <b>Extract All</b>, and then follow the instructions. Extract or move the folder to any location on your computer, including your <em>Program Files</em> folder or <em>Desktop</em>.</li>
				<li>
					On macOS, unzip the file by double-clicking it, and then move the extracted app to any location on your computer, including your <em>Applications </em>folder or <em>Desktop</em>.</li>
				<li>
					The<b> </b>Linux version of Processing is a <em>.tar </em>archive. Extract or move the folder to any location on your computer, including your home folder or desktop.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Once you’re finished, open the newly extracted folder. <a href="#figure1-1" id="figureanchor1-1">Figure 1-1</a> shows an abridged listing of what you can expect to see in your file manager. Next, locate and run the executable file named <em>processing</em>. On macOS, you’ll just have a single file named <em>processing</em>.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The application layout may vary slightly among systems and Processing versions, but the key elements are outlined in <a href="#figure1-2" id="figureanchor1-2">Figure 1-2</a>. If you’re a Mac user, you’ll find the <em>menu bar</em> in its usual position at the top of your screen. Note that the upper right button in the Processing interface is labeled <em>Java</em>. This is because Processing comes bundled with Java mode as the default.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Next, activate Python Mode. Click the <b>Java</b> button and select <b>Add Mode</b> from the drop-down menu; then, from the Contribution Manager window that appears, choose <b>Python Mode for Processing</b>. Finally, click <b>Install</b>. You can now change between Python and Java mode by using the drop-down menu. Switch to Python (<a href="#figure1-3" id="figureanchor1-3">Figure 1-3</a>).</p>

			<h2 id="h1-500969c01-0002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_4" title="4"/>Your First Sketch</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Processing refers to programs as <em>sketches</em>. Given the visual and artistic nature of what you are likely to produce, it’s a fitting term. Select <b>File</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>New</b> to create a new sketch, or use the associated keyboard shortcut (listed alongside the menu entry).</p>
			<p>Enter the following lines of code:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">size</span>(500, 500)<span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'Hello, World!'</span>)</code></pre>
			<p>
				I’ll go through the specifics of this code in a bit. For now, save the sketch by using <b>File</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>Save As</b> and name it <em>hello_world</em>.</p>
			<p>
				You will notice that Processing creates a new folder named <em>hello_world</em>; within it, there are two files: <em>hello_world.pyde </em>and <em>sketch.properties </em>(<a href="#figure1-4" id="figureanchor1-4">Figure 1-4</a>). Depending on your system’s configuration, you may or may not see the file extension (<em>.pyde</em>). To reopen any sketch, locate and open the <em>.pyde</em> file.</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f01004" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01004.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-4">Figure 1-4</a>: The contents of your <em>hello_world</em> sketch folder</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>You may want to add other assets to your sketch folders, such as images and fonts, but more on that later.</p>
			<p>
				Next, click the play (<span class="MenuArrow">▶</span>) button to execute the code. Better yet, use the associated keyboard shortcut: <span class="KeyCaps">ctrl</span>-R for Windows and Linux, or <span class="Wingdings"></span>-R for macOS. A gray 500 × 500 pixel <em>display window</em> should appear. In the console, which is the black area at the bottom of the editor, Processing should display <code>Hello, World!</code> (<a href="#figure1-5" id="figureanchor1-5">Figure 1-5</a>).</p>
			<p>
				Now let’s get back to the code you entered in this file; it uses two Processing functions: <code>size()</code> and <code>print()</code>. <em>Functions</em> are named instructions, sort of like dog commands for computers. Some commands are simple, like “sit,” but something like “fetch” may involve specifying what it is that Fido should retrieve.</p>
			<p>
				Python functions consist of a function name followed by opening and closing <em>parentheses</em>, which is where you provide arguments. In the case of my dog-command analogy, “ball” could be an argument for “fetch.” The <code>size()</code> function (<a href="#figure1-6" id="figureanchor1-6">Figure 1-6</a>) takes two arguments: the first represents the width of your sketch, and the second is the height.</p>
			<p>In this case, the display window is 500 pixels wide by 500 pixels high.</p>
			<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_5" title="5"/>

				<img alt="f01005" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01005.png"/>

					<p><a id="figure1-6">Figure 1-6</a>: Anatomy of a <span class="LiteralInCaption"><code>size()</code></span> function</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The <code>print()</code> function writes to the console. This function takes a single argument: the phrase <code>'Hello, World!'</code> Because this is text—or technically, <em>string</em> data—you need to wrap it in quotation marks. You can use single or double quotes, but be sure to use the same type for both opening and closing quotes.</p>
			<p>
				Python classifies every value according to a <em>data type</em>, which determines how the value is handled and the operations you can perform on it. For example, you can perform arithmetic operations—like division or subtraction—on numeric data types but not on strings. In this chapter, you’ll deal with three data types:</p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li><span class="RunInHead">String</span>  Text data, like ‘Hello, World!’</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Integer</span>  Numbers without decimal points, such as 1, –27, or 422</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Floating-point</span>  Numbers that include a decimal point, such as 1.618</li>
			</ol>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_6" title="6"/>What separates Processing code from standard Python code are some of its functions; the <code>size()</code> function, for example, is Processing-specific. In other words, it won’t work outside the Processing environment. The <code>print()</code> function, on the other hand, is a built-in element of the standard Python programming language. It works in Processing’s Python Mode and any other Python program.</p>
			<p>
				Throughout this book, I usually refer to Processing-exclusive features in the context of <em>Processing,</em> and standard Python features with the term <em>Python</em>. If this is confusing, think of them as one and the same. At this point, distinguishing Processing from Python isn’t crucial; you will understand the differences in time.</p>

					<h2>How Do I Know What Arguments to Provide?</h2>
					<p class="BoxBodyFirst">The type, number, and order of arguments vary according to the function, and some functions don’t require arguments.

			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0001">Comments</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">If you want Python to ignore any part of your code, you can comment it out. This feature is useful for leaving notes, in plain English, to yourself or anybody else editing your code. Let’s add a few comments to your <em>hello_world</em> file:</p>
			<pre><code><span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">1</span> <span class="ProcessingGray"># dimensions of the display window measured in pixels</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">size</span>(500, 500)<span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'Hello, World!'</span>) <span class="ProcessingGray"># writes hello world to the console area</span><span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">2</span> <span class="ProcessingPurple">'''</span><span class="ProcessingPurple">This is a multiline comment.</span><span class="ProcessingPurple">Any code between the opening and closing triple-quotes is ignored.</span><span class="ProcessingPurple">'''</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'How are you?'</span>)</code></pre>
			<p>
				Comments come in two types: single- and multiline. As shown here, use a <code>#</code> character for single-line comments <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">1</span> and <code>'''</code> (or <code>"""</code>) for multiline comments <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">2</span>.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_7" title="7"/>While working through the tasks in this book, add comments to remind yourself how the code works. Comments are also useful for debugging code. For instance, if you suspect that some lines are causing your program to fail, you can temporarily disable them by commenting them out.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0002">Whitespace</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Python, and by extension Processing’s Python Mode, is whitespace-sensitive. You need to be careful where you insert space characters or tabs. As an example, add a few spaces to the beginning of the <code>size()</code> line; then run the sketch:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray"># dimensions of the display window measured in pixels</span> <span class="ProcessingBlue">size</span>(500, 500)<span class="LiteralGray">print('Hello, World!')  # writes hello world to the console area</span><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span></code></pre>
			<p>
				When you run the sketch, the message bar turns red, and Processing displays an error message (<a href="#figure1-7" id="figureanchor1-7">Figure 1-7</a>). Python relies on indentation to distinguish blocks of code. The indented line breaks the program because Python did not encounter any code to define a new block for the <code>size()</code> function.</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f01007" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01007.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-7">Figure 1-7</a>: A whitespace error</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>Correct the code by removing the problematic space characters you’ve just added.</p>
			<p>You’ll come to understand more about when and where to use indentation as you progress through these chapters. For now, though, pay careful attention to any space and tab characters that affect the indentation of your code.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_8" title="8"/>Errors</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Whitespace issues are not the only error type you will encounter. On occasion, you’re likely to miss the odd parenthesis, comma, or quotation mark, especially when starting out. Try removing the closing parenthesis from your <code>size()</code> function, like so:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray"># dimensions of the display window measured in pixels</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">size</span>(500, 500<span class="LiteralGray">print('Hello, World!')  # writes hello world to the console area</span><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span></code></pre>
			<p>
				Now run the code and observe the console output. Note the suggestion in the message bar (<a href="#figure1-8" id="figureanchor1-8">Figure 1-8</a>). Pretty smart, huh?</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f01008" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01008.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-8">Figure 1-8</a>: The alert in the message bar (red) suggests a possible cause for the error that Processing encountered.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				This is an example of a <em>syntax error</em>, and it’s not the first you’ll encounter. Just as English sentences must begin with a capital letter and end with a full stop, Python functions must have an opening and a closing parenthesis. When you have multiple arguments, you need to separate them using commas. This set of rules is called <em>syntax</em>. If you don’t conform to the rules, Python will be confounded and report an error.</p>
			<p>Error messages are not always so clear or accurate, but they can provide a clue as to where to start searching for bugs. Copying and pasting the messages into a search engine can sometimes help you find a solution.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0004">Color</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">You can describe colors in various ways in Processing. To keep things simple, I’ll stick with <em>hexadecimal </em>values for the first example. If you’re familiar with <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_9" title="9"/>graphics software like Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or GIMP, you may have seen hexadecimal values in the color picker for those programs.</p>
			<p>
				Processing includes its own color selector (<a href="#figure1-9" id="figureanchor1-9">Figure 1-9</a>), which you can access from the menu bar by selecting <b>Tools</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>Color Selector</b>. You can use this color selector to mix and sample color values. The value that begins with a hash mark (#) is the hexadecimal; you use the <b>Copy</b> button to copy it, so that you can paste it into the code editor.</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f01009" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01009.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-9">Figure 1-9</a>: Processing color selector</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Your screen displays color pixels by mixing three primary colors—much as you mix <span class="ColorText" style="color:#ed1c24">red</span>, <span class="ColorText" style="color:#baad00">yellow</span>, and <span class="ColorText" style="color:#3a52a4">blue</span> paint in art class. However, your screen relies on <span class="ColorText" style="color:#ed1c24">red</span>, <span class="ColorText" style="color:#05a74a">green</span>, and <span class="ColorText" style="color:#3a52a4">blue</span> primaries instead. Furthermore, because light blends color in an <em>additive</em> manner, pixels that combine all three primaries at full intensity appear as white. Conversely, a complete absence of any color results in a black pixel. Other colors contain varied quantities of red, green, and blue. For example, a bright red mixture is created as follows:</p>
			<p><span class="ColorText" style="color:#ed1c24">100%</span> | <span class="ColorText" style="color:#05a74a">0%</span> | <span class="ColorText" style="color:#3a52a4">0%</span></p>
			<p>
				A hexadecimal color value is composed of six hexadecimal digits (<code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, . . . , <code>9</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>E</code>, <code>F</code>) and can be split into three pairs. Each pair corresponds to a primary color. Here’s the value for bright red:</p>
			<p><code>#<span class="ColorText" style="color:#ed1c24">FF</span><span class="ColorText" style="color:#05a74a">00</span><span class="ColorText" style="color:#3a52a4">00</span></code></p>
			<p>
				The <code><span class="ColorText" style="color:#ed1c24">FF</span></code> represents a red quantity; the middle <code><span class="ColorText" style="color:#05a74a">00</span></code> is for green; the rightmost <code><span class="ColorText" style="color:#3a52a4">00</span></code> is for blue. For reasons I won’t get into here, <code>FF</code> is the equivalent of 100 percent. Also, remember that you are mixing light, so <code>#FFFFFF</code> is white, and <code>#000000</code> is black. Here are some other examples:</p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li><span class="RunInHead">100 percent blue</span> <code>#<span class="ColorText" style="color:#ed1c24">00</span><span class="ColorText" style="color:#05a74a">00</span><span class="ColorText" style="color:#3a52a4">FF</span></code></li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Dark green</span> <code>#<span class="ColorText" style="color:#ed1c24">00</span><span class="ColorText" style="color:#05a74a">66</span><span class="ColorText" style="color:#3a52a4">00</span></code></li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Dark gray</span> <code>#<span class="ColorText" style="color:#ed1c24">50</span><span class="ColorText" style="color:#05a74a">50</span><span class="ColorText" style="color:#3a52a4">50</span></code></li>
			</ol>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_10" title="10"/>Use the selector to experiment further and observe how the hexadecimal values change as you select different colors.</p>
			<p>
				The <code>fill()</code> function sets the color used to fill shapes. It accepts up to four arguments, depending on the color system you are using. For hexadecimal color, use a single argument: the six-digit value prefixed with a <code>#</code>, wrapped in quotes.</p>
			<p>
				Add the following line to the bottom of your <em>hello_world</em> sketch:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">fill</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#FF0000'</span>)</code></pre>
			<p>
				You have now set the fill color to red. To see this in effect, let’s draw a rectangle. The <code>rect()</code> function is used for drawing rectangles, and it takes four arguments:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">rect</span>(<var>x_coordinate</var>, <var>y_coordinate</var>, <var>width</var>, <var>height</var>)</code></pre>
			<p>
				The first two arguments specify the location of the rectangle’s upper left corner (<a href="#figure1-10" id="figureanchor1-10">Figure 1-10</a>). Processing’s x-coordinates begin from the left edge of the display window; the y-coordinates begin from the top edge.</p>
			<figure>

				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-10">Figure 1-10</a>: Processing’s coordinate system</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The x-y coordinate for the upper left corner of the display window is (0, 0), and the lower right is (500, 500). So to move the rectangle down, increase the y-coordinate value. Add a new rectangle line to your <em>hello_world</em> sketch:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="LiteralGray">fill('#FF0000')</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">rect</span>(100, 150, 200, 300)</code></pre>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_11" title="11"/>Run the sketch to confirm that the output matches <a href="#figure1-11" id="figureanchor1-11">Figure 1-11</a>. Experiment with the <code>rect()</code> arguments to affect the rectangle’s size and position.</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f01011" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01011.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-11">Figure 1-11</a>: <span class="LiteralInCaption"><code>rect(100, 150, 200, 300)</code></span></p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				You now should be familiar with Processing’s coordinate system. The <code>rect()</code> is one of many drawing functions; you’ll be introduced to a few more shortly.</p>
			<p>In this section, you’ve also learned to define color using hexadecimal values that describe different quantities of red, green, and blue light. And you now can use a color picker, like the one included with Processing, to mix and sample any values you require. You’ll see other systems for defining color in Processing, but for most of this book, you’ll use hexadecimal.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0005">Fills and Strokes</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">When you write a <code>fill()</code> line, every shape thereafter is filled in with the color you specify. That color won’t change until Processing encounters the next <code>fill()</code> line. In this way, Processing is like painting: you grab a brush and dip it in paint, and then everything you paint is influenced by the brush and color you last selected. When you want to paint in a different style or color, you change out your brush or dip it in a different pot. If you want to disable the fill altogether, use <code>noFill()</code>.</p>
			<p>
				Add the following code to the end of your <em>hello_world</em> file to draw a smaller red rectangle, an orange square, and a square with no fill:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="ProcessingGray"># small red rectangle</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">rect</span>(10, 15, 20, 30)<span class="ProcessingGray"># orange square</span><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_12" title="12"/><span class="ProcessingBlue">fill</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#FF9900'</span>)<span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotationHang">1</span> <span class="ProcessingBlue">rect</span>(50, 100, 150, 150)<span class="ProcessingGray"># fill-less square</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">noFill</span>()<span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotationHang">2</span> <span class="ProcessingBlue">square</span><span class="ColorText" style="color:#999999">(250, 100, 150)</span></code></pre>
			<p>
				For a square, you have two options: use a <code>rect()</code> <span aria-label="annotation1" class="CodeAnnotation">1</span> with matching width and height (third and fourth) arguments. Or, use the <code>square()</code> <span aria-label="annotation2" class="CodeAnnotation">2</span> function, which takes three arguments: x, y, and extent.</p>
			<p>
				Processing interprets lines of code from top to bottom. As a result, shapes at the bottom of your code appear at the top of the visual “stack.” So the previous code produces the shapes in <a href="#figure1-12" id="figureanchor1-12">Figure 1-12</a>.</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f01012" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01012.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-12">Figure 1-12</a>: The no-fill square—the last line of your code—is the topmost shape.</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><em>Stroke</em> is another term for <em>outline</em>, and you’re likely to use the following three stroke functions: <code>stroke()</code> to change the color, <code>strokeWeight()</code> to change the width, and <code>noStroke()</code> to disable the stroke altogether. Like <code>fill()</code> and <code>noFill()</code>, the stroke functions affect everything below them.</p>
			<p>For a white stroke, 3 pixels in width, insert the following lines above the shape code:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">stroke</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#FFFFFF'</span>)<span class="ProcessingBlue">strokeWeight</span>(3)<span class="LiteralGray">fill('#FF0000')</span><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span></code></pre>

			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0006">Background Color</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">To change the background color, use the <code>background()</code> function. Add a background line to the end of your sketch:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="LiteralGray">square(250, 100, 150)</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">background</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#004477'</span>)</code></pre>
			<p>
				Run the sketch and note how everything has disappeared; the entire display window is now a flat shade of blue. This is because <code>background('#004477')</code> draws over everything before it, which will be useful when you start working with animation. For now, move that line to the top of your code so you can see the shapes again (<a href="#figure1-14" id="figureanchor1-14">Figure 1-14</a>):</p>

			<h2 id="h1-500969c01-0003">Color Modes</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">I’ll use hexadecimal color values for the rest of the chapter, but here’s a quick introduction to other color modes, because at some point, you may need to express colors in something other than hexadecimal. For example, say you want to write code that darkens a bright red fill. First, you will recall that this is a shade of bright red:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">fill</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#FF0000'</span>)</code></pre>
			<p>You can also represent this color as the following in RGB:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">fill</span>(255, 0, 0)</code></pre>
			<p>
				In this arrangement, each red/green/blue value is comma-separated. As you might have already deduced, <code>255</code> is equivalent to <code>FF</code> (which itself is equivalent to 100 percent). To make the red half as bright, you can subtract <code>127</code> from <code>255</code>. However, trying to subtract <code>127</code> from <code>FF</code> is tricky because you’re dealing with a mix of hexadecimal and decimal numbers. In this instance, it’s easier to stick with decimal values (255 – 127 = 128).</p>
			<p>
				To use the <code>fill(255, 0, 0)</code> cits <code>colorMode()</code> set to <code>RGB</code>. You don’t need to specify this, though, as it’s the default mode. Here’s how it works: if Processing detects a single argument in quotes (like <code>'#FF0000'</code>), it interprets it as hexadecimal, but if you provide three arguments, it automatically knows that you are using the system of 0 to 255.</p>
			<p>
				However, you can use another mode: HSB. Once set to <code>HSB</code> mode, the three <code>fill()</code> arguments represent <em>hue</em>, <em>saturation</em>, and <em>brightness</em>, respectively. To better understand how those variables affect color, let’s take a look at the color picker of GIMP, an open source image editor (<a href="#figure1-15" id="figureanchor1-15">Figure 1-15</a>).</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_15" title="15"/>Rotating the large triangle adjusts the H value between 0 and 360 degrees; the H (hue) field corresponds to the white line at the triangle’s lower right tip. You move the small white circle (inside the triangle) to adjust the S (saturation) and V (value) fields. <em>Value</em> and <em>brightness</em> are interchangeable terms in this context, so the V corresponds to the B in HSB.</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f01015" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01015.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-15">Figure 1-15</a>: Hue: 330 degrees; saturation: 90 percent; value/brightness: 80 percent</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>If you have GIMP installed, or software with a similar color picker, I encourage you to experiment with it. To mimic the GIMP scheme in Processing, set the color mode accordingly:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">colorMode</span>(<span class="ProcessingKhaki">HSB</span>, 360, 100, 100)</code></pre>
			<p>
				The <code>HSB</code> represents the mode, <code>360</code> represents the range of degrees for hue, and the two <code>100</code> arguments represent a range of 0 to 100 percent for saturation and brightness. You would now write a red fill as follows:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">fill</span>(0, 100, 100)</code></pre>
			<p>
				This is because bright red lies at 0 degrees of rotation on the hue ring (which begins at “East” in the GIMP mixer) and has a saturation and brightness of 100 percent (<a href="#figure1-16" id="figureanchor1-16">Figure 1-16</a>).</p>
			<figure>
				<img alt="f01016" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01016.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-16">Figure 1-16</a>: Hue: 0 degrees; saturation: 100 percent; value/brightness: 100 percent</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_16" title="16"/>In HSB mode, shifting along the color spectrum—from red to orange to yellow to green, and so on—is a simple matter of adding to or subtracting from the H value. Attempting the same in RGB mode is not so easy, as you need to adjust the proportions of each primary color.</p>
			<p>
				The chapters to come will cover even more on color. Consult the relevant Processing.py reference entries for <code>colorMode()</code> and <code>fill()</code> if you need more detail.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-500969c01-0004">2D Primitives</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Let’s move on to drawing basic shapes. Begin a new sketch (<b>File</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>New</b>) and save it as <em>primitives_2d</em> (<b>File</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>Save As</b>). Add this code to set things up before proceeding:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">size</span>(600, 300)<span class="ProcessingBlue">background</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#004477'</span>)<span class="ProcessingBlue">noFill</span>()<span class="ProcessingBlue">stroke</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#FFFFFF'</span>)<span class="ProcessingBlue">strokeWeight</span>(3)</code></pre>
			<p>
				Now when you run the sketch, thanks to <code>background('#004477')</code>, an empty blue display window appears. Any shapes that you draw will have no fill and a white stroke of 3 pixels.</p>
			<p>
				Next, draw three points by using the <code>point()</code> function (<a href="#figure1-17" id="figureanchor1-17">Figure 1-17</a>):</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">point</span>(100, 25)<span class="ProcessingBlue">point</span>(200, 25)<span class="ProcessingBlue">point</span>(150, 75)</code></pre>
			<p>
				The <code>point()</code> function accepts two arguments, which represent the x- and y-coordinates. The active <code>strokeWeight()</code> determines the size of the points.</p>

			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0007">triangle()</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The <code>triangle()</code> function draws a triangle. The six arguments represent three x-y coordinate pairs. I have grouped each x-y pair by removing the space character after every other argument so it’s easier to read:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">triangle</span>(100,25, 200,25, 150,75)</code></pre>
			<p>Python is not sensitive to whitespace between arguments, so if you find it helpful to format your code in a similar fashion, feel free to do so.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0008">ellipse()</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The <code>ellipse()</code> function draws an ellipse. The first pair of arguments represents an x-y coordinate that marks the center of the ellipse; the second pair of arguments represents the ellipse’s width and height:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">ellipse</span>(100,100, 100, 50)</code></pre>
			<p>
				For a circle, you can use the <code>ellipse()</code> function with matching width and height (third and fourth) arguments. Alternatively, you can use the <code>circle()</code> function, which takes three arguments: x, y, and diameter.</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">circle</span>(100,100, 50)</code></pre>
			<p>
				The <code>circle()</code> and <code>square()</code> functions are relatively new to Processing, so you may find that many of the examples (<b>File</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>Examples</b>) and online code rely on only <code>ellipse()</code> and <code>rect()</code>.</p>

			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0009">quad()</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The <code>quad()</code> function draws a <em>quadrilateral</em> (a four-sided polygon). Essentially, it’s like a triangle function with an extra point, and its eight arguments represent four x-y coordinate pairs:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">quad</span>(260,180, 360,200, 380,250, 260,280)</code></pre>
			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0010">line()</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The <code>line()</code> function draws a straight line between two points. The first pair of arguments represents the starting x-y coordinates, and the second pair, the ending x-y coordinates:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">line</span>(450,80, 520,220)</code></pre>
			<p>
				As with points and shapes, the width of a line is affected by any preceding <code>strokeWeight()</code> function.</p>
			<p>
				The 2D primitive functions provide an easy way to draw shapes in the display window. There’s one more shape function to review, <code>arc()</code>, but it’s a bit more involved than the other shapes. Variables and arithmetic operators will prove useful for drawing arcs, so I’ll cover those first. Before moving on, though, here’s a quick challenge to practice what you’ve learned so far.</p>
			<h4 class="HeadProject"><span>Challenge #1: Rainbow Task</span></h4>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Begin a new sketch (<b>File</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>New</b>) and save it as <em>rainbow</em> (<b>File</b><span class="MenuArrow">▶</span><b>Save As</b>). Add this code to get started:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">size</span>(600, 300)<span class="ProcessingBlue">background</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#004477'</span>)<span class="ProcessingBlue">noStroke</span>()</code></pre>

			<h2 id="h1-500969c01-0005">Variables</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Variables</em> are placeholders for information—much like when you use letters in algebra to represent a value. In fact, Python variables look and behave quite similarly.</p>
			<p>
				Begin a new sketch and save it as <em>variables</em>. To keep things simple, you’ll print values to the console area. Add the following code to set up the sketch and print its width and height (in pixels):</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">size</span>(600, 400)<span class="ProcessingBlue">background</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#004477'</span>)<span class="ProcessingBlue">noStroke</span>()<span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(<span class="ProcessingRaspberry">width</span>)<span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(<span class="ProcessingRaspberry">height</span>)</code></pre>
			<p>
				If you run the sketch, the display window’s width and height should be printed to the console, as shown in <a href="#figure1-20" id="figureanchor1-20">Figure 1-20</a>.</p>
			<p>
				But notice that you never explicitly defined <code>width</code> or <code>height</code>. Processing automatically assigned the width and height of the display window to these two variables. From this, you can establish that <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> are variables for which Processing maintains the values. Predefined variables like these are called <em>system variables</em>.</p>
			<p>
				However, you are not limited to system variables; you can also define your own. When declaring new variables, assign them a value by using an equal sign (<code>=</code>), which is called the <em>assignment operator</em>. Try this out with a new variable named <code>x</code>:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span>
x = 10<span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(x) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 10 in the console</span></code></pre>
			<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_20" title="20"/><figure>
				<img alt="f01020" src="image_fi/500969c01/f01020.png"/>
				<figcaption>
					<p><a id="figure1-20">Figure 1-20</a>: Printing variables to the console</p>
				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The variable <code>x</code> is equal to 10, so the <code>print()</code> function displays a <code>10</code> in the console.</p>
			<p>
				You can name your variables whatever you like, provided that the name contains only alphanumeric and underscore characters, doesn’t begin with a number, and doesn’t clash with any reserved keywords or variables (like <code>width</code>). For example, the following shows several possible variable names (the comments indicate which are correct):</p>
			<pre><code>playerlives = 3 <span class="ProcessingGray"># correct</span>
playerLives = 3 <span class="ProcessingGray"># correct</span>
player_lives = 3 <span class="ProcessingGray"># correct</span>
player lives = 3 <span class="ProcessingGray"># incorrect (contains a space)</span>
player-lives = 3 <span class="ProcessingGray"># incorrect (contains a hyphen)</span>
player2lives = 3 <span class="ProcessingGray"># correct</span>
2playerlives = 3 <span class="ProcessingGray"># incorrect (begins with a number)</span></code></pre>
			<p>
				Whether you should name a multiword variable using <em>camelCase</em>, underscores, or another convention is a matter of style (and vociferous debate), but it’s good to decide on a naming convention and stick to it, as you’ll make extensive use of variables in Processing.</p>
			<aside epub:type="sidebar">
				<div class="top hr">
					<hr/>

				<section class="note">
					<h2><span class="NoteHead">NOTE</span></h2>
					<p>
							The camelCase convention is used to form one word from multiple words; each new word except the first starts with a capital letter. In this way, you can tell words apart without using spaces. You’ll use the camelCase convention for naming user-defined functions (<span class="xref">Chapter 9</span>) and the UpperCamelCase convention for objects (<span class="xref">Chapter 10</span>).<span class="ColorText" style="color:#auto"> </span></p>

			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_21" title="21"/>Now, add three more variables to your script for use as arguments in a <code>rect()</code> function:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span>
y = 30
w = 100
h = w<span class="ProcessingBlue">rect</span>(x, y, w, h)</code></pre>
			<p>
				The <code>y</code> variable indicates the y-coordinate; <code>w</code> indicates the width; and <code>h</code> indicates the height value for the <code>rect()</code> function. Notice that the <code>h</code> value is equal to the <code>w</code> value (of 100). You’ve already defined <code>x</code> as equal to 10. Run the sketch to confirm that it displays a white square positioned near the upper left corner of the display window (<a href="#figure1-21" id="figureanchor1-21">Figure 1-21</a>).</p>

			<p>Experiment further on your own with shapes and variables. In the next section, you’ll learn to use variables to perform mathematical calculations.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-500969c01-0006">Arithmetic Operators</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Arithmetic operators</em> perform arithmetic operations on <em>operands</em>; this is far simpler than it probably sounds. For instance, in the expression 1 + 3, the plus sign is the operator, and the numbers 1 and 3 are the operands. To better understand how this all works in Python, let’s go through some examples.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0011">Basic Operations</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Add the following line to the end of your <em>variables</em> sketch to calculate what variable <code>x</code> plus 2 is equal to:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(x + 2)</code></pre>
			<p>
				Run the sketch and check the bottom line of the console output. I’m guessing the code did exactly what you expected. Earlier in the chapter, you assigned a value of 10 to variable <code>x</code>, and 10 + 2 is equal to 12, which is what you will see in your console.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_22" title="22"/>You can also subtract (see the comments for the result):</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="LiteralGray">print(x + 2)</span> <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 12</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span><b>(x - 2)        </b><span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 8</span></code></pre>
			<p>
				Use the <code>*</code> operator for multiplication:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(x * 2) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 20</span></code></pre>
			<p>Now try this line, but before running it, see if you can predict the result:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(1 + 2 * 3) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays ???</span></code></pre>
			<p>
				The console displays a <code>7</code> and not a <code>9</code> because multiplication occurs before addition. Certain operators take precedence over others. Remember PEMDAS? It’s an acronym to help you recall the <em>order of operations</em>, which is parentheses first, then exponents, then multiplication/division, then addition/subtraction. (Some people may be more familiar with the acronyms BEDMAS or BODMAS, which use the terms <em>brackets</em> for <em>parentheses,</em> and <em>of</em> or <em>order</em> to indicate exponents.)</p>
			<p>If you want the addition to happen first, use parentheses:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingGray">print (1 + 2 * 3)</span> <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 7</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>((1 + 2) * 3) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 9</span></code></pre>
			<p>
				For division, use a forward slash (<code>/</code>):</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(4 / 2) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 2</span></code></pre>
			<p>Be aware that dividing two integers always produces an integer result (integers are whole numbers, as opposed to those with a decimal point). For example:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(3 / 2) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 1</span></code></pre>
			<p>Processing discards any decimal digits, effectively rounding down the result. Note, however, that this is Python 2 behavior. At the time of this writing, Processing’s Python Mode uses Python 2.7. If you ever find yourself writing Python 3 code, the result will be 1.5.</p>
			<p>For floating-point division in Python 2, define at least one of your operands by using a decimal point:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(3 / 2.0) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 1.5</span></code></pre>
			<p>This line displays a 1.5 in Python versions 2 and 3. This book avoids any Python code that isn’t compatible with Python 3. Rest assured, you can apply your newly acquired coding skills in Python 2 and 3 development. Should Processing switch to Python 3, your code will still run fine.</p>
			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_23" title="23"/>Of course, division-by-zero operations will result in errors (<a href="#figure1-22" id="figureanchor1-22">Figure 1-22</a>).</p>

			<p>Processing uses other arithmetic operators (for floor division and exponents) that aren’t necessary to review here. The modulo operator, however, warrants a brief introduction.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-500969c01-0012">Modulo Operator</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The <em>modulo operator</em> calculates the remainder of a division operation and is expressed as a percentage sign (<code>%</code>). Take 5 divided by 2 as an example. You could say the answer is 2.5, or you could say the answer is 2 remainder 1, because 2 “goes into” 5 twice with 1 left over.</p>
			<p>The modulo operator performs the latter operation and provides the remainder. Here’s some code contrasting division and modulus (as before, the comments show the output):</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(5.0 / 2) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 2.5</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(5.0 % 2) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 1.0</span></code></pre>
			<p>
				It may not be evident why this operator is useful. However, many important algorithms, such as those used in cryptography, use modular arithmetic. For now, consider that modulo operations resulting in a <code>0</code> indicate that numbers divide exactly. Among other uses, this is handy for establishing whether a number is odd or even:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(7 % 2) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 1, therefore 7 is odd</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">print</span>(6 % 2) <span class="ProcessingGray"># displays 0, therefore 6 is even</span></code></pre>
			<p>You’ll use the modulo operator in the chapters to come.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-500969c01-0007"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_24" title="24"/>Arcs</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Now that I’ve covered variables and some basic math, I can introduce the <code>arc()</code> function, which is used to draw elliptical arcs. Let’s look at a few examples to see how this one works. Create a new sketch and save it as <em>disk_space_analyzer</em>. Add the following setup code that will define some visual parameters to get started:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">size</span>(600, 600)<span class="ProcessingBlue">background</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#004477'</span>)<span class="ProcessingBlue">stroke</span>(<span class="ProcessingPurple">'#FFFFFF'</span>)<span class="ProcessingBlue">strokeWeight</span>(3)<span class="ProcessingBlue">noFill</span>()</code></pre>
			<p>
				The <code>arc()</code> function takes the following arguments, expanded across multiple lines here for easier comprehension (recall that Python is not sensitive to whitespace between function arguments):</p>
			<pre><code><span class="ProcessingBlue">arc</span>( <var>x_coordinate</var>, <var>y_coordinate</var>, <var>width</var>, <var>height</var>, <var>start_angle</var>, <var>end_angle</var>

)</code></pre>
			<p>
				The green overlay in <a href="#figure1-23" id="figureanchor1-23">Figure 1-23</a> helps illustrate how the arguments work. Processing draws the arc along the perimeter of an invisible ellipse centered in the display window. The center of this ellipse has an x-y coordinate of <code>width/2</code>, <code>height/2</code>; it’s 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels high. An angle of <code>0</code> is positioned at East, which opens clockwise to an angle of <code>2</code>, which looks more like around 115 degrees of rotation.</p>
			<p>
				The reason for this large angle is that Processing uses <em>radians </em>and not degrees to measure angles; 1 radian is equal to roughly 57.3 degrees. Why use radians? Radians, a standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics, provide more natural and elegant formulas for circular motion. Think about this: why are there 360 degrees in a full circle? Why not 300 or 100, or even a million degrees? While I’m on the topic, why are there 60 minutes in an hour? Or 24 hours in a day? Much of this has to do with ancient counting systems.</p>

				Rather than dividing a circle into an arbitrary number of slices (like 360), the radian system is based on a proportional measurement involving a circle’s <em>radius</em>. <a href="#figure1-24" id="figureanchor1-24">Figure 1-24</a> illustrates how radians are defined. Beginning with the left graphic, take the radius of any circle; create an arc of that same length; then measure the angle formed between the tips of the arc and the center of the circle to derive one radian.</p>

				If 1 radian is equal to approximately 57.3 degrees, 2 radians equal 114.6 degrees. This makes 180 degrees equivalent to roughly 3.142 radians (<a href="#figure1-25" id="figureanchor1-25">Figure 1-25</a>). Do you recognize that number? Yep, it’s pi!</p>

			<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_26" title="26"/>Processing provides the <code>degrees()</code> and <code>radians()</code> functions for converting between the systems, but you should be fine working in radians if you can remember a few key measurements. For starters, 0 degrees is equal to 0 radians, and 180 degrees is equal to <em>π</em> radians. Therefore, 360 degrees is equal to 2π radians. In Processing, you can use the system variable <code>PI</code> instead of writing a lengthy decimal.</p>
			<p>
				Add the following code to draw a half-circle and a full circle using <code>arc()</code> functions:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">arc</span>(<span class="ProcessingRaspberry">width</span>/2, <span class="ProcessingRaspberry">height</span>/2, 300, 300, 0, <span class="ProcessingKhaki">PI</span>) <span class="ProcessingGray"># half-circle</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">arc</span>(<span class="ProcessingRaspberry">width</span>/2, <span class="ProcessingRaspberry">height</span>/2, 400, 400, 0, <span class="ProcessingKhaki">PI</span>*2) <span class="ProcessingGray"># full-circle</span></code></pre>
			<p>
				Run the sketch. The first new arc begins at <code>0</code> and ends at <code>PI</code>, resulting in a half-circle; the second outermost and largest arc has an end angle of <code>PI*2</code>, and therefore, it appears as a complete circle.</p>
			<p>
				If you want to close an arc, so as to form a “slice,” add an additional <code>PIE</code> argument. Add the following line to test this out:</p>
			<pre><code><span class="LiteralGray">. . .</span><span class="ProcessingBlue">arc</span><span class="ProcessingRaspberry">(width</span>/2, <span class="ProcessingRaspberry">height</span>/2, 350, 350, 3.4, (<span class="ProcessingKhaki">PI</span>*2)-(<span class="ProcessingKhaki">PI</span>/2), <span class="ProcessingKhaki">PIE</span>)</code></pre>
			<p>
				The arc spans from 3.4 radians (around 10 o’clock) to ~4.7 radians (12 o’clock). <a href="#figure1-26" id="figureanchor1-26">Figure 1-26</a> depicts the final result. You can identify the most recent arc by its slice shape.</p>

			<p class="BodyFirst">Now for a final challenge before moving on to <span class="xref">Chapter 2</span>. A <em>disk usage analyzer</em> presents a graphical representation of  a disk drive’s contents. The Linux GNOME Disk Usage Analyzer (also known as <em>Baobab</em>) is one example of such software, and its charts make good use of arcs.</p>
			<p>
				Recreate the ring chart graphic in <a href="#figure1-27" id="figureanchor1-27">Figure 1-27</a> by using what you have learned thus far. Begin by commenting out your existing arc lines, and then continue to work in the same sketch file. (The text and number labels have been added to assist you with calculations; do not add them to your recreation.)</p>

			<p class="BodyFirst">You now have Python Mode for Processing up and running. You also know how to set up a new sketch, set the size of your display window, and apply a background color. You’ve learned to display messages like ‘Hello, World!’ in the console and draw shapes using 2D primitive functions. You’ve also learned about color and how to define the color of your strokes and fills in hexadecimal, or using RGB and HSB color modes. In addition, you should  understand how to use radians to measure angles and work with the <code>arc()</code> function.</p>
			<p>
				While getting started with Processing, you’ve also learned a few Python programming fundamentals, like how to manage whitespace, add code comments, and use arithmetic operators to perform mathematical operations. You’ve also seen how to use Python variables, which are placeholders for data. Processing includes system variables, like <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>, but you can store values in your own variables, provided that the variable names adhere to Python’s naming rules.</p>
			<p>
				In <span class="xref">Chapter 2</span>, you’ll learn how to draw more organic, as opposed to geometric, shapes. You’ll also gain insight into the inner workings of vector graphics software like Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape.</p>
