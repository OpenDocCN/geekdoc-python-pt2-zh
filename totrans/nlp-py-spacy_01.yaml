    have never succeeded in decoding rongorongo inscriptions or even figuring out
    whether those inscriptions are writing or proto-writing (pictographic symbols
    that convey information but are language independent). Moreover, although we know
    that the creators of the glyphs also erected Moai, the large statues of human
    figures for which the island is most famous, the builders’ motivations remain
    unclear. We can only speculate.

    entries for words in current use. In 2010, a team of researchers at Harvard University
    and Google counted about 1,022,000 words in a body of digitized texts containing
    approximately 4 percent of all books ever published. The study estimated that
    the language would grow by several thousand words a year. Assigning each word
    to a corresponding number would take too long.
  id: totrans-48
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But even if you tried to do it, you’d find it impossible, for several reasons,
    to determine the number of words used in a natural language. First of all, it’s
    unclear what really counts as an individual word. For example, should we count
    the verb “count” as one word, or two, or more? In one scenario, “count” might
    mean “to have value or importance.” In a different scenario, it might mean, “to
    say numbers one after another.” Of course, “count” can also be a noun.

    separate entities, too? Should we count *loanwords* (words adopted from foreign
    languages), scientific terms, slang, and abbreviations? Evidently, the vocabulary
    of a natural language is defined loosely, because it’s hard to figure out which
    groups of words to include. In a programming language like Java, an attempt to
    include an unknown word in your code will force the compiler to interrupt processing
    with an error.

    end up with the error missing INTO keyword. That’s because a SQL parser—like any
    other parser used in a programming language—relies on hardcoded rules, which means

    node; then it passes the sum on to an activation function. The activation function
    generates a result that typically ranges from 0 to 1, thus producing a new signal
    that is passed on to each node in the successive layer, or, in the case of the
    output layer, an output parameter. Usually, the output layer has as many nodes
    as the number of possible distinct outputs for the given algorithm. For example,
    a neural network implemented for a part-of-speech tagger should have as many nodes
    in the output layer as the number of part-of-speech tags supported by the system,
    as illustrated in [Figure 1-6](../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch01fig06).

- en: The architecture of a real neural network model can be quite complex; it’s formed
    by a number of different layers. Thus, the neural network model used in spaCy
    is a *convolutional neural network (CNN)* that includes a convolutional layer,
    which is shared between the part-of-speech tagger, dependency parser, and named
    entity recognizer. The convolutional layer applies *a set of detection filters
    to regions of input data to test for the presence of specific features.*

    the sentence into chunks. You can consider a sentence in NLP as a matrix in which
    each row represents a word in the form of a vector. So if each word vector had
    300 dimensions and your sentence was five words long, you’d get a 5 × 300 matrix.
    The convolutional layer might use a detection filter size of three, applied to
    three consecutive words, thus having a tiling region size of 3 × 300\. This should
    provide sufficient context for making a decision on what part-of-speech tag each
    word is.

    what part-of-speech the word “count” is. The problem is that this word can be
    either a verb or a noun, depending on the context. But this task becomes a breeze
    when the tagger sees the chunk that includes the “we count on” word combination.
    In that context, it becomes clear that the word “count” can be only a verb.
