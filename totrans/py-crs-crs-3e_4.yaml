- en: Programmers spend a lot of time writing, reading, and editing code, and using
    a text editor or an IDE (integrated development environment) to make this work
    as efficient as possible is essential. A good editor will do simple tasks, like
    highlighting your code’s structure so you can catch common bugs as you’re working.
    But it won’t do so much that it distracts you from your thinking. Editors also
    have useful features like automatic indenting, markers to show appropriate line
    length, and keyboard shortcuts for common operations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An *IDE* is a text editor with a number of other tools included, like interactive
    debuggers and code introspection. An IDE examines your code as you enter it and
    tries to learn about the project you’re building. For example, when you start
    typing the name of a function, an IDE might show you all the arguments that function
    accepts. This behavior can be very helpful when everything works and you understand
    what you’re seeing. But it can also be overwhelming as a beginner and difficult
    to troubleshoot when you aren’t sure why your code isn’t working in the IDE.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These days, the lines have blurred between text editors and IDEs. Most popular
    editors have some features that used to be exclusive to IDEs. Likewise, most IDEs
    can be configured to run in a lighter mode that’s less distracting as you work,
    but lets you use the more advanced features when you need them.

    configured to work with a recent version of Python that’s installed on your system,

    editors can be fun, but it’s also a way to avoid the work of learning a new language.

    Some changes can be made through the interface, and some will require changes
    in configuration files. These changes will sometimes take effect for everything
    you do in VS Code, while others will affect only the files within the folder that
    contains the configuration file.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you use a mix of tabs and spaces in your code, it can cause problems in your
    programs that are difficult to diagnose. When working in a *.py* file with the
    Python extension installed, VS Code is configured to insert four spaces whenever
    you press the TAB key. If you’re writing only your own code and you have the Python
    extension installed, you’ll likely never have an issue with tabs and spaces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, your installation of VS Code may not be configured correctly. Also,
    at some point, you may end up working on a file that has only tabs or a mix of
    tabs and spaces. If you suspect any issue with tabs and spaces, look at the status
    bar at the bottom of the VS Code window and click either **Spaces** or **Tab Size**.
    A drop-down menu will appear that lets you switch between using tabs and using
    spaces. You can also change the default indentation level and convert all indentation
    in the file to either tabs or spaces.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of tabs or spaces, highlight several lines of code. This will make the invisible

    will show up as an arrow.

    actions. If you’re switching between your keyboard and mouse frequently, look
