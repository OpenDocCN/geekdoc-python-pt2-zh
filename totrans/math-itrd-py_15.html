<p class="epigraph"><em>Steve: We’re lost.<br/>Mike: How lost are we?</em></p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/fintro-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="intro">When many people think of math, they think of equations and operations that are “set in stone” and answers that are either right or wrong. They might be surprised to learn how much guessing and checking we’ve done in our algebra explorations already.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this chapter, you learn to crack passwords and hidden messages in an indirect fashion. It’s kind of like the “guess-and-check” method of <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, where we just plugged a bunch of integers into an equation and if any made the equation true, we printed them out. This time, we’ll guess a bunch of values, not just one. It’s not the most elegant way of solving a problem, but with a computer at our disposal, sometimes brute force works best.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To figure out our secret phrase, we generate guesses and then rate them on how well they match the target. But here’s where we depart from a guess-and-check method: we keep the best guesses and mutate them, randomly, again and again until we uncover the message. The program <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_248"/>won’t know which letters are right and which letters are wrong, but we get closer and closer by mutating the best guess we’ve made so far. Although this method might not seem promising right now, you’ll see that it helps crack the code surprisingly quickly. This method is called a <em>genetic algorithm</em>, which computer scientists use to find solutions to problems based on the theory of natural selection and evolutionary biology. It was inspired by biological organisms that adapt and mutate, and the way they build on tiny advantages, as we saw in the Sheep model in <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>, on Classes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For more complicated problems, however, random mutating won’t be enough to solve our problem. In those cases, we add <em>crossover</em>, which we use to combine the most fit organisms (or best guesses) to improve their likelihood of cracking the code, just like how the fittest organisms are more likely to pass down a combination of their genetic material. All this activity, other than the scoring, will be fairly random, so it might be surprising that our genetic algorithms work so well.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12_1">USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM TO GUESS PHRASES</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Open IDLE and create a new file called <em>geneticQuote.py</em>. Instead of guessing a number like in <a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a>, this program tries to guess a secret phrase. All we have to tell the program is the number of characters it guessed correctly—not where or which characters, just how many.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Our program is going to be able to do much better than guess short passwords.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12_1_1">WRITING THE MAKELIST() FUNCTION</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To see how this works, let’s create a target phrase. Here’s a long sentence that my son came up with from the comic book <em>Naruto</em>:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">target = <span class="pd_green">"I never go back on my word, because that is my Ninja way."</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In English, we have a bunch of characters we can choose from: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, a space, and some punctuation.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">characters = <span class="pd_green">" abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.',?!"</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s create a function called <span class="literal">makeList()</span> that will randomly create a list of characters that’s the same length as <span class="literal">target</span>. Later, when we try to guess what the target phrase is, we’ll score the guess by comparing it character by character with the target. A higher score means a guess is closer to the target. Then, we’ll randomly change one of the characters in that guess to see if that increases its score. It seems surprising that such a random method will ever get us to the exact target phrase, but it will.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, import the <span class="literal">random</span> module and write the <span class="literal">makeList()</span> function, as shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list1">Listing 12-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="pd_g1"><em>genetic<br/>Quote.py</em></span><br/><span class="pd_orange">import</span> random<br/><br/>target = <span class="pd_green">"I never go back on my word, because that is my Ninja way."</span><br/>characters = <span class="pd_green">" abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.',?!"</span><br/><br/><span class="pd_orange">def</span> <span class="pd_blue">makeList</span>():<br/><span class="pd_green">    '''Returns a list of characters the same length</span><br/><span class="pd_green">    as the target'''</span><br/>    charList = [] <span class="pd_red">#empty list to fill with random characters</span><br/>    <span class="pd_orange">for</span> i <span class="pd_orange">in</span> <span class="pd_purple">range</span>(<span class="pd_purple">len</span>(target)):<br/>        charList.append(random.choice(characters))<br/>    <span class="pd_orange">return</span> charList</p>&#13;
<p class="listing" id="ch12list1"><em>Listing 12-1: Writing the <span class="literal">makeList()</span> function to create a list of random characters that’s the same length as the target</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_249"/>Here, we create an empty list called <span class="literal">charList</span> and loop over the list the same number of times as there are characters in the target. On each loop,the program puts a random character from <span class="literal">characters</span> into <span class="literal">charList</span>. Once the loop is done, it returns <span class="literal">charList</span>. Let’s test it to make sure it works.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12_1_2">TESTING THE MAKELIST() FUNCTION</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">First, let’s find out what the length of the target is, and check that our random list is the same length:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="pd_purple">len</span>(target)<br/><span class="pd_blue2">57</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; newList = makeList()<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; newList<br/><span class="pd_blue">['p', 'H', 'Z', '!', 'R', 'i', 'e', 'j', 'c', 'F', 'a', 'u', 'F', 'y', '.',</span><br/><span class="pd_blue">'w', 'u', '.', 'H', 'W', 'w', 'P', 'Z', 'D', 'D', 'E', 'H', 'N', 'f', ' ',</span><br/><span class="pd_blue">'W', 'S', 'A', 'B', ',', 'w', '?', 'K', 'b', 'N', 'f', 'k', 'g', 'Q', 'T',</span><br/><span class="pd_blue">'n', 'Q', 'H', 'o', 'r', 'G', 'h', 'w', 'l', 'l', 'W', 'd']</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="pd_purple">len</span>(newList)<br/><span class="pd_blue">57</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We measured the length of the <span class="literal">target</span> list, and it’s 57 characters long. Our new list is the same length, 57 characters. Why make a list instead of a string? We make a list because lists are sometimes easier to work with than strings. For example, you can’t simply replace a character in a string with another character. But in a list you can, as you can see here:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; a = <span class="pd_green">"Hello"</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; a[0] = <span class="pd_green">"J"</span><br/><span class="pd_red">Traceback (most recent call last):</span><br/><span class="pd_red">  File "&lt;pyshell#16&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;</span><br/><span class="pd_red">    a[0] = "J"</span><br/><span class="pd_red">TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; b = [<span class="pd_green">"H"</span>,<span class="pd_green">"e"</span>,<span class="pd_green">"l"</span>,<span class="pd_green">"l"</span>,<span class="pd_green">"o"</span>]<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; b[0] = <span class="pd_green">"J"</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; b<br/><span class="pd_blue">['J', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']</span></p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_250"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this example, when we try to replace the first item in the <span class="literal">"Hello"</span> string with <span class="literal">"J"</span>, Python doesn’t let us, and we get an error. Doing the same thing using a list, however, is no problem.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the case of our <em>geneticQuote.py</em> program, we want to see the random quote as a string because that’s easier to read. Here’s how to print out a list as a string, using Python’s <span class="literal">join()</span> function:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="pd_purple">print</span>(<span class="pd_green">''</span>.join(newList))<br/><span class="pd_blue">pHZ!RiejcFauFy.wu.HWwPZDDEHNf WSAB,w?KbNfkgQTnQHorGhwllWd</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Those are all the characters in <span class="literal">newList</span>, but in string form. It doesn’t look like a very promising start!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12_1_3">WRITING THE SCORE() FUNCTION</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now let’s write a function called <span class="literal">score()</span> to score each guess by comparing it character by character with the target, like in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list2">Listing 12-2</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="pd_g1"><em>genetic<br/>Quote.py</em></span><br/><span class="pd_orange">def</span> <span class="pd_blue">score</span>(mylist):<br/><span class="pd_green">    '''Returns one integer: the number of matches with target'''</span><br/>    matches = 0<br/>    <span class="pd_orange">for</span> i <span class="pd_orange">in</span> <span class="pd_purple">range</span>(<span class="pd_purple">len</span>(target)):<br/>        <span class="pd_orange">if</span> mylist[i] == target[i]:<br/>            matches += 1<br/>    <span class="pd_orange">return</span> matches</p>&#13;
<p class="listing" id="ch12list2"><em>Listing 12-2: Writing the <span class="literal">score()</span> function for scoring a guess</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">score()</span> function takes each item in a list we feed it (<span class="literal">mylist</span>) and checks if the first character of <span class="literal">mylist</span> matches the first character of the <span class="literal">target</span> list. Then the function checks whether the second characters match, and so on. For each character matched, we increment <span class="literal">matches</span> by 1. In the end, this function returns a single number, not which ones are right, so we don’t actually know <em>which</em> characters we got right!</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What’s our score?</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; newList = makeList()<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; score(newList)<br/><span class="pd_blue">0</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Our first guess was a total strikeout. Not a single match!</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12_1_4">WRITING THE MUTATE() FUNCTION</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now we’ll write a function to mutate a list by randomly changing one character. This will allow our program to “make guesses” until we get closer to the target phrase we’re trying to guess. The code is in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list3">Listing 12-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="pd_g1"><em>genetic<br/>Quote.py</em></span><br/><span class="pd_orange">def</span> <span class="pd_blue">mutate</span>(mylist):<br/>    <span class="pd_green">'''Returns mylist with one letter changed'''</span><br/>    newlist = <span class="pd_purple">list</span>(mylist)<br/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_251"/>&#13;
    new_letter = random.choice(characters)<br/>    index = random.randint(0,<span class="pd_purple">len</span>(target)-1)<br/>    newlist[index] = new_letter<br/>    <span class="pd_orange">return</span> newlist</p>&#13;
<p class="listing" id="ch12list3"><em>Listing 12-3: Writing the <span class="literal">mutate()</span> function for changing one character in a list</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, we copy the elements of the list to a variable called <span class="literal">newlist</span>. We then randomly choose a character from the <span class="literal">characters</span> list to be the new letter that will replace one of the existing characters. We randomly choose a number between 0 and the length of the target to be the index of the letter we replace. Then we set the character in <span class="literal">newlist</span> at that index to be the new letter. This process repeats over and over again in a loop. If the new list has a higher score, it’ll become the “best” list, and the best list will keep getting mutated in the hope of improving its score even more.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12_1_5">GENERATING A RANDOM NUMBER</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Starting off the program after all the function definitions, we make sure of our randomness by calling <span class="literal">random.seed()</span>. Calling <span class="literal">random.seed()</span> resets the random number generator to the present time. Then we make a list of characters and, since the first list is the best one so far, declare it the best list. Its score will be the best score.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="pd_g1"><em>genetic<br/>Quote.py</em></span><br/>random.seed()<br/>bestList = makeList()<br/>bestScore = score(bestList)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We keep track of how many guesses we’ve made:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">guesses = 0</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now we start an infinite loop that will mutate <span class="literal">bestList</span> to make a new guess. We calculate its score and increment the <span class="literal">guesses</span> variable:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="pd_orange">while True</span>:<br/>    guess = mutate(bestList)<br/>    guessScore = score(guess)<br/>    guesses += 1</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If the score of the new guess is less than or equal to the best score so far, the program can “continue,” as shown next. That means it will go back to the beginning of the loop, since it wasn’t a good guess, and we don’t need to do anything else with it.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">    <span class="pd_orange">if</span> guessScore &lt;= bestScore:<br/>        <span class="pd_orange">continue</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If we’re still in the loop, that means the guess is good enough to print out. We print its score, too. We can print the list (as a string), the score, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_252"/>how many total guesses were made. If the score of the new guess is the same as the length of the target, then we’ve solved the quote and we can break out of the loop:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">    <span class="pd_purple">print</span>(<span class="pd_green">''</span>.join(guess),guessScore,guesses)<br/>    <span class="pd_orange">if</span> guessScore == <span class="pd_purple">len</span>(target):<br/>        <span class="pd_orange">break</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Otherwise, the new guess must be better than the best list so far, but not perfect yet, so we can declare it the best list and save its score as the best score:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">    bestList = <span class="pd_purple">list</span>(guess)<br/>    bestScore = guessScore</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Listing 12-4 shows the entire code for the <em>geneticQuote.py</em> program.</p>&#13;

The point was to show how a method of scoring guesses and randomly mutating the “best guess so far” could produce accurate results in a surprisingly short amount of time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now, you can use this idea of scoring and mutating thousands of random guesses to solve other problems, too.</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_254"/>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch12_2">SOLVING THE TRAVELING SALESPERSON PROBLEM (TSP)</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One of my students was unimpressed with the quote-guessing program because “we already know what the quote is.” So let’s use a genetic algorithm to solve a problem we don’t already know the solution for. <em>The Traveling Salesperson Problem</em>, or <em>TSP</em> for short, is an age-old brainteaser that is easy to understand but can become very difficult to solve. A salesperson has to travel to a given number of cities, and the goal is to find the route with the shortest distance. Sounds easy? And with a computer, we should simply be able to run all the possible routes through a program and measure their distances, right?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It turns out, above a certain number of cities, the computational complexity gets too much even for today’s supercomputers. Let’s see how many possible routes there are when you have six cities, as shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig1">Figure 12-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch12fig1"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f254-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 12-1: The number of paths between</em> <span class="literal">n</span> <em>cities for</em> <span class="literal">n</span> <em>between 2 and 6</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When there are two or three cities, there’s only one possible route. Add a fourth city, and it could be visited between any of the previous three, so multiply the previous number of routes by 3. So between four cities there are three possible routes. Add a fifth city, and it could be visited between any of the previous four, so there are four times as many as the previous step, so 12 possible routes. See the pattern? Between <em>n</em> cities, there are</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img alt="image" src="../images/e254-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">possible routes. So between 10 cities there are 181,440 possible routes. Between 20 cities, there are 60,822,550,204,416,000 routes. What’s after a trillion? Even if a computer can check a million routes per second, it would still take almost 2,000 years to calculate. That’s too slow for our purposes. There must be a better way.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12_1_6">USING GENETIC ALGORITHMS</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Similar to our quote-guessing program, we’re going to create an object with a route in its “genes” and then score its route by how short it is. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_255"/>The best route will then be mutated randomly, and we’ll score its mutation. We could take a bunch of “best routes,” splice together their lists, and score their “offspring.” The best part of this exploration is we <em>don’t</em> know the answer already. We could give the program a set of cities and their locations, or just have it randomly draw cities and try to optimize the route.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Open a new Processing sketch and call it <em>travelingSalesperson.pyde</em>. The first thing we should create is a <span class="literal">City</span> object. Each city will have its own x- and y-coordinate and a number we use to identify it. That way, we can define a route using a list of city numbers. For example, [5,3,0,2,4,1] means you start at city 5 and go to city 3, then city 0, and so on. The rules are the salesperson has to finally return to the first city. <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list5">Listing 12-5</a> shows the <span class="literal">City</span> class.</p>&#13;

We also get a number that’s the city’s identifying number. In the <span class="literal">display()</span> method, we choose a color (sky blue, in this case) and create an ellipse at that location. We turn off the fill after drawing the city with the <span class="literal">noFill()</span> function, since no other shapes need to be filled in with color.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s make sure that works. Let’s create the <span class="literal">setup()</span> function, declaring a size for the display window and creating an instance of our <span class="literal">City</span> class. Remember, we have to give it a location of two coordinates and an identifying number as in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list6">Listing 12-6</a>.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_256"/>It might help to have the city display its number above it. To do that, add this to the city’s <span class="literal">display()</span> method, just before <span class="literal">noFill()</span>:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">        <span class="pd_blue2">textSize</span>(20)<br/>        <span class="pd_blue2">text</span>(<span class="pd_g2">self</span>.number,<span class="pd_g2">self</span>.x-10,<span class="pd_g2">self</span>.y-10)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We declare the size of the text using Processing’s built-in <span class="literal">textSize()</span> function. Then we use the <span class="literal">text()</span> function to tell the program what to print (the number of the city) and where to print it (10 pixels to the left and above the city). While we’re creating cities, let’s start a <span class="literal">cities</span> list and put a few more cities on the screen in random locations. To use methods from the <span class="literal">random</span> module, we have to import <span class="literal">random</span> at the top of the file:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="pd_g2">import</span> <span class="pd_blue2">random</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now we can update our <span class="literal">setup()</span> function like in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list7">Listing 12-7</a>.</p>&#13;

<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_257"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the <span class="literal">setup()</span> function, we’ve added a loop to run six times. It adds a <span class="literal">City</span> object at a random location on the screen 50 units from the edges. The next loop iterates over all the elements in the <span class="literal">cities</span> list and displays each one. Run this, and you’ll see six cities in random locations, labeled with their ID numbers, as in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig3">Figure 12-3</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><a id="ch12fig3"/><img alt="image" src="../images/f257-01.jpg"/></div>&#13;
<p class="caption"><em>Figure 12-3: Six cities, labeled with their numbers</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now let’s think about the route between the cities. We put the <span class="literal">City</span> objects (containing their locations and numbers) into the <span class="literal">cities</span> list, and eventually that list of numbers (our “genetic material”) will consist of the city numbers in a certain order. So the <span class="literal">Route</span> object needs a random list of numbers, too: a random sequence of all the city numbers. Of course, the numbers will be range from 0 to 1 less than the number of cities. We don’t want to keep changing numbers here and there in our code whenever we want to change the number of cities, so we’ll create a variable for the number of cities. Put this line at the beginning of the file, before the <span class="literal">City</span> class:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">N_CITIES = 10</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Why is <span class="literal">N_CITIES</span> in all capital letters? Throughout all the code, we won’t be changing the number of cities. So it’s not really a variable; instead, it’s a constant. It’s customary in Python to capitalize constant names to set them apart from variables. This doesn’t change the way Python deals with them at all; variables with capitalized names can still be changed. So be careful.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We’ll use <span class="literal">N_CITIES</span> wherever we would be using the total number of cities, and we’ll only need to change the value once! Place the code shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list8">Listing 12-8</a> after the <span class="literal">City</span> class.</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_258"/>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="pd_g2">class</span> Route:<br/>    <span class="pd_g2">def</span> <span class="pd_blue2">__init__</span>(<span class="pd_g2">self</span>):<br/>        <span class="pd_g2">self</span>.distance = 0<br/>        <span class="pd_gray">#put cities in a list in order:</span><br/>        <span class="pd_g2">self</span>.cityNums = <span class="pd_blue2">random</span>.sample(<span class="pd_blue2">list</span>(<span class="pd_lime">range</span>(N_CITIES)),N_CITIES)</p>&#13;
<p class="listing" id="ch12list8"><em>Listing 12-8: The <span class="literal">Route</span> class</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, we set the route’s distance (or length, but <span class="literal">length</span> is a keyword in Processing) to zero, and then we create a <span class="literal">cityNums</span> list that puts the numbers of the cities in a random order for that route.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can use the <span class="literal">random</span> module’s <span class="literal">sample()</span> function to give Python a list and then sample a number of items from that list by telling it how many items to choose randomly. It’s like <span class="literal">choice()</span>, but it won’t select an item more than once. In probability, it’s called “sampling without replacement.” Enter the following in IDLE to see how sampling works:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; n = <span class="pd_purple">list</span>(<span class="pd_purple">range</span>(10))<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; n<br/><span class="pd_blue">[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="pd_orange">import</span> random<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; x = random.sample(n,5)<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; x<br/><span class="pd_blue">[2, 0, 5, 3, 8]</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here, we create a list called <span class="literal">n</span> of the numbers between 0 and 9 by calling <span class="literal">range(10)</span> and converting it (it’s a “generator”) into a list. We then import the <span class="literal">random</span> module and ask Python to use the <span class="literal">sample()</span> function to pick a sample of five items from list <span class="literal">n</span> and save them to list <span class="literal">x</span>. In our <span class="literal">Route</span> code in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list8">Listing 12-8</a>, since the variable <span class="literal">N_CITIES</span>, representing the number of cities, is 10, we’re choosing 10 numbers at random using <span class="literal">range(10)</span>, the numbers 0 to 9, and assigning them to the <span class="literal">Route</span>’s <span class="literal">cityNums</span> property.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">And how will this display? Let’s draw purple lines between the cities. You can use any color you’d prefer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Drawing lines between cities like this should remind you of drawing lines between the points on a graph in algebra or trigonometry lessons. The only difference is now at the end of the graph we have to return to the starting point. Remember using <span class="literal">beginShape</span>, <span class="literal">vertex</span>, and <span class="literal">endShape</span> in Chapter 6? Just like we used lines to draw a shape, we’ll draw the <span class="literal">Route</span> object as the outline of a shape, except this time we just won’t fill it in. Using <span class="literal">endshape(CLOSE)</span> will automatically close the loop! Add the code in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list9">Listing 12-9</a> to the <span class="literal">Route</span> class.</p>&#13;

<p class="listing" id="ch12list14"><em>Listing 12-14: Keeping track of random improvements</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Before the <span class="literal">setup()</span> function, we create a variable to count the number of random improvements that are made by the program. At the same time, we create a variable we’ll use in a few steps to count the mutated improvements.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <span class="literal">setup()</span>, we created <span class="literal">route1</span> to be the first <span class="literal">Route</span>, we named it the “best route,” and we named its distance the <span class="literal">record_distance</span>. Since we want to share these variables with other functions, we declare them to be global variables at the beginning of the function.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <span class="literal">draw()</span>, we keep generating new random routes and checking if they’re better than the one we think is the best route so far. Since we’re using only 10 cities, this could pay off with an optimal solution, if we leave it running a while. You’ll see that it only requires around a dozen random improvements. But, remember, there are only 181,440 unique routes through 10 cities. One 10-city route is shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12fig8">Figure 12-8</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you change the number of cities to 20, however, your program will just keep running, for days if you let it, and will probably not get close to an optimal solution. We need to start using the idea from the phrase-guessing program at the beginning of the chapter of scoring our guesses and mutating the best ones. Unlike before, we’ll create a “mating pool” of the best routes and combine their number lists as if they were genes.</p>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch12_1_10">APPLYING THE PHRASE-GUESSING MUTATION IDEA</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The list of numbers (the cities the salesperson will visit in order) will be the genetic material of the <span class="literal">Route</span>. First, we see how well some randomly mutated routes solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (just like with our phrase-guessing programs) and then we mutate and “mate” the better routes with each other to (hopefully) create a more optimal route.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch12_1_11">MUTATING TWO NUMBERS IN A LIST</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s write a method to randomly mutate two of the numbers in a <span class="literal">Route</span> object’s <span class="literal">cityNums</span> list. It’s really just a swap. You can probably guess how we’ll randomly choose two numbers and make the city numbers that have those indices in the list trade places.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python has a unique notation for swapping the values of two numbers. You can swap two numbers without creating a temporary variable. For example, if you enter the code in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list15">Listing 12-15</a> in IDLE, it wouldn’t work.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x = 2</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">y = 3</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x = y</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">y = x</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x</span><br/><span class="pd_blue">3</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">y</span><br/><span class="pd_blue">3</span></p>&#13;
<p class="listing" id="ch12list15"><em>Listing 12-15: The wrong way to swap the values of variables</em></p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_266"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you change the value of <span class="literal">x</span> to be the same as <span class="literal">y</span> by entering <span class="literal">x = y</span>, they both become 3. Now when you try to set <span class="literal">y</span> to be the same as <span class="literal">x</span>, it’s not set to the original value of <span class="literal">x</span> (2), but the current value of <span class="literal">x</span>, which is 3. So both variables ended up as 3.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But you <em>can</em> swap the values on the same line, like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x = 2</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">y = 3</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x,y = y,x</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x</span><br/><span class="pd_blue">3</span><br/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">y</span><br/><span class="pd_blue">2</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Swapping the values of two variables like this is very useful for the mutating we’re about to do. Instead of limiting the swapping to only two numbers, we can mutate more cities. We can put the swapping in a loop so the program will choose any number of cities and swap the first two numbers, then the next pair, and so on. The code for the <span class="literal">mutateN()</span> method is shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list16">Listing 12-16</a>.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="pd_g2">def</span> mutateN(<span class="pd_g2">self</span>,num):<br/>    indices = <span class="pd_b1">random</span>.sample(<span class="pd_b1">list</span>(<span class="pd_lime1">range</span>(N_CITIES)),num)<br/>    child = Route()<br/>    child.cityNums = <span class="pd_g2">self</span>.cityNums[::]<br/>    <span class="pd_lime1">for</span> i <span class="pd_g2">in</span> <span class="pd_lime1">range</span>(num-1):<br/>        child.cityNums[indices[i]],child.cityNums[indices[(i+1)%num]] = \<br/>        child.cityNums[indices[(i+1)%num]],child.cityNums[indices[i]]<br/>    <span class="pd_lime1">return</span> child</p>&#13;
<p class="listing" id="ch12list16"><em>Listing 12-16: Writing the <span class="literal">mutateN()</span> method, for mutating any number of cities</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We give the <span class="literal">mutateN()</span> method <span class="literal">num</span>, a number of cities to swap. Then the method makes a list of indices to swap by taking a random sample from the range of city numbers. It creates a “child” <span class="literal">Route</span> and copies its own city number list to the child. Then it swaps <span class="literal">num-1</span> times. If it swapped the full <span class="literal">num</span> times, the first city swapped would simply get swapped with all the other indices and end up where it started.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">That long line of code is simply the <span class="literal">a,b = b,a</span> syntax we saw before, only with the two <span class="literal">cityNums</span> being swapped. The mod (<span class="literal">%</span>) operator makes sure your indices don’t exceed <span class="literal">num</span>, the number of cities in your sample. So if you’re swapping four cities, for example, when <span class="literal">i</span> is <span class="literal">4</span>, it changes <span class="literal">i + 1</span> from <span class="literal">5</span> to <span class="literal">5 % 4</span>, which is 1.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, we add a section to the end of the <span class="literal">draw()</span> function to mutate the best <span class="literal">Route</span>’s list of numbers and test the mutated <span class="literal">Route</span>’s length, as shown in <a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12list17">Listing 12-17</a>.</p>&#13;

<h3 class="h3" id="ch12_3">SUMMARY</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we didn’t just use Python to answer the types of questions you get in math class whose answers are already known. Instead, we used indirect methods (scoring a string of characters or a route through a bunch of cities) to find solutions to questions without an answer key!</p>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_272"/>&#13;
<p class="indent">To do this, we mimicked the behavior of organisms whose genes mutate, taking advantage of the fact that some mutations are more useful than others for solving the problem at hand. We knew our target phrase at the beginning of the chapter, but to figure out whether our final route was the optimal one, we had to save the city locations and run the program a few more times. This is because genetic algorithms, just like real organisms, can only work with what they start out with, and they often end up in a non-optimal rut, as you saw.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">But these indirect methods are surprisingly effective and are used extensively in machine learning and industrial processes. Equations are good for expressing a very simple relationship, but many situations are not that simple. Now you have plenty of useful tools, like our “sheep and grass” model, fractals, cellular automata, and, finally, genetic algorithms, for studying and modeling very complicated systems.</p>&#13;
