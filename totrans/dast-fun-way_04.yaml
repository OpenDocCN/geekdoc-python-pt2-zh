- en: This chapter introduces stacks and queues, two data structures that retrieve
    stored data based on the order in which it was inserted. Stacks and queues are
    very similar and require only minor implementation differences. However, the simple
    fact that stacks return the most recently inserted data first, while queues return
    the oldest, completely changes the behavior of algorithms and the efficiency with
    which we can access data.

    along an individual path until it hits a dead end. Queues enable breadth-first
    search, which shallowly explores adjacent paths before digging deeper. As we will

    how we surf web pages or conduct coffee research.

    of insertions. When processing incoming network requests, for example, we want
    to process earlier requests first. In contrast, we use stacks when we want to
    process the most recent item first. For instance, programming languages may use
    stacks to process function calls. When a new function is called, the current state
    is pushed onto a stack and execution jumps into the new function. When a function

    they handle the data, and specifically the order in which they return their items,
    gives these similar data structures radically different behavior. Stacks return
    the newest data they’ve stored, making them ideal for prioritizing the most recent
