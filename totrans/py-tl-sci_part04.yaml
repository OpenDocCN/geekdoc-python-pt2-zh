- en: Of all the Python libraries that are important to science, NumPy, Matplotlib,
    and pandas are arguably the most essential. These three libraries form a triptych,
    with each panel built on the one before. Together, they serve as an immense canvas
    for most scientific and data analysis work in Python.

- en: What makes these libraries essential? For one thing, they’re mature, reliable,
    and used across many disciplines. As established libraries, they come with enormous
    support networks consisting of online forums, tutorials, and example use cases
    as well as many excellent print and ebooks dedicated to each. Further, they form
    the basis for other important libraries. Some knowledge of NumPy, Matplotlib,
    and pandas is needed to proficiently use Python in most scientific and engineering
    endeavors.

- en: In the following three chapters, we’ll look at each of these packages in turn.
    As whole volumes can be dedicated to each library, we’ll focus on the purpose
    of the libraries, the components that have proven difficult or frustrating for
    new users, and the basic functionality needed to begin applying the packages to
    your own projects.
