- en: Baby boomers are Americans born between 1946 and 1964\. They form a large demographic
    cohort—about 20 percent of the American population—so they’ve had a huge influence
    on all aspects of American culture. The financial industry was quick to cater
    to their needs, which for decades concerned investment growth. But in 2011, the
    oldest boomers reached age 65 and began retiring in droves, at the rate of 10,000
    *per day*! With an average life span longer than that of preceding generations,
    a boomer may enjoy a retirement as long as their career. Funding this 30- to 40-year
    period is a big problem and a big business.

- en: In the years when financial advisers were mainly focused on *growing* boomers’
    wealth, they relied on the simple “4 Percent Rule” for retirement planning. Simply
    stated, for every year you’re retired, if you spend an amount no larger than 4
    percent of the savings you had *in the first year of retirement*, you’ll never
    run out of money. But as Mark Twain observed, “All generalizations are false,
    including this one!” The value of our investments and the amount we spend are
    constantly in flux, often due to forces outside of our control.

- en: As a more sophisticated alternative to the 4 Percent Rule, the financial industry
    adopted Monte Carlo simulation (see [Chapter 11](ch11.xhtml#ch11) for an overview
    of MCS). With MCS, you can test and compare retirement strategies over thousands
    of lifetimes. The goal is to identify how much money you can spend each year in
    retirement, given your life expectancy, without exhausting your savings.

    life spans, while capturing the true cyclicity and interdependency of the stock
    and bond markets and inflation. This will allow you to evaluate and compare different
    strategies for achieving a secure and happy retirement.

    this program from online calculators that select individual *years* at random

    aren’t pure chaos; bull and bear markets are cyclic, as are inflationary trends.
    The same events that cause stocks to decline also impact the price of bonds and
    the rate of inflation. Picking years at random ignores this interdependency and

    a 29-30-31 retirement range, and 50,000 cases. If you run this scenario, you should

    tax rate, this leaves a net income of only $60,000\. According to the Pew Research
    Center, the median disposable (after-tax) income of the American middle class
    is currently $60,884, so you’re hardly living high on the hog, despite being a
    millionaire. If you want $80,000 in *disposable* income, you must divide by 1
    minus the effective tax rate; in this case, that’s $80,000 / (1 – 0.25) = $106,667\.

    chance of going broke, depending on the investment type!

    30-year cases using historical intervals that will result in bad and good results,
    such as starting at the beginning of the Great Depression versus the end of WWII,
    but only run the extreme cases. For each year in each case, print out the year,
    the returns rate, the inflation rate, and the outcome. Even better, edit the bar
    chart display to use each *year’s* outcome rather than each *case’s* outcome,
    for a convincing visual explanation.

    Use the S&P 500, 10-year Treasury bond, and three-month Treasury bill text files
    that I provided at the start of the chapter and add anything else you like, such
    as small-cap stocks, international stocks, or even gold. Just remember that the
    time intervals should be the same in each file or list.

    input adds up to 100 percent. Then create a blended list by weighting and adding
    the returns for each year. Finish it off by displaying the investment types and
    percentages at the top of the bar chart display.

    Depression (1939–1949) or a Great Recession (2007–2009) during a 30-year retirement.
    You’ll need to identify which index numbers in the returns lists correspond to
    these events, then tally how many times they occur over however many cases are
    run. Display the results in the shell.
