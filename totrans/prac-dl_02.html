<p class="noindents">If you’re already familiar with Python, you can skip this chapter. This summary is for those who are comfortable with programming but who aren’t familiar with Python. We’ll cover only enough of the language to be able to read and understand the code examples in this book. If you have little to no experience with computer programming, you should first read a more complete text like <em>Python Crash Course</em>, 2nd Edition, by Eric Matthes (No Starch Press, 2019).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python is, at its simplest, sequential statements grouped into blocks via indentation; data structures like numbers, strings, tuples, lists, and dictionaries; control structures including <span class="literal">if-elif-else</span>, for loops, while loops, with statements, and try-except blocks; functions with optional nested functions; and a large library of importable modules. We’ll cover each of these features.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1_10">The Python Interpreter</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">On a Linux system, Python is typically used in one of two ways. You can run the Python interpreter from the command <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"/>line and enter commands interactively, or you can run a script of Python commands. Simply enter <span class="literal">python3</span> in your console to use Python interactively:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">$ <span class="codestrong1">python3</span><br/>&#13;
Python 3.6.7 (default, Oct 22 2018, 11:32:17)<br/>&#13;
[GCC 8.2.0] on linux<br/>&#13;
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.<br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As you can see, Python opens a prompt for you to enter commands into, beginning with <span class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>. Type an expression like <span class="literal">1+2</span> and hit <span class="literal">ENTER</span>. Python will respond immediately by evaluating the equation and passing you the result. When you want to exit the console, use <span class="literal">CTRL</span>-D.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1_11">Statements and Whitespace</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">As in almost every other programming language, unless modified by a control flow structure, statements in Python are executed one after the other in the order in which they appear in the code. Consider, for example, this code:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">statement1<br/>&#13;
statement2<br/>&#13;
statement3</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here <span class="literal">statement1</span> will be executed first, followed by <span class="literal">statement2</span>, and then, finally, <span class="literal">statement3</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Multiple statements can be grouped into units called <em>blocks</em>. For example, the condition of an <span class="literal">if</span> statement evaluating to <span class="literal">True</span> could trigger a block to run. Syntactically, the statements that go with the <span class="literal">if</span> need to be marked in some way so that the computer knows which statements to execute. Classic languages like Pascal used bulky <span class="literal">BEGIN</span> and <span class="literal">END</span> keywords. The C family of languages, which includes most of the languages in current widespread use, uses curly brackets: “{" and “}".</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In Python, we use indentation. This makes reading Python code somewhat elegant as it follows the format of a traditional outline. It also makes the code more visually consistent across authors and leaves less room for confusion. In Python, when we use an <span class="literal">if else</span> statement, we can easily see which statements should run with which part of the condition, even if we have not yet understood the format of the <span class="literal">if</span> statement. For example:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="codestrong1">if</span> condition1:<br/>&#13;
    statement1<br/>&#13;
    statement2<br/>&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">else:</span><br/>&#13;
    statement3</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"/>The indentation makes it clear that <span class="literal">statement1</span> and <span class="literal">statement2</span> are executed when <span class="literal">condition1</span> (whatever it is) is true. Similarly, we see that <span class="literal">statement3</span> is executed when <span class="literal">condition1</span> is not true.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice the colons in the preceding <span class="literal">if</span> example. Python uses these to designate blocks of code. You must place a colon after any control statement, and then the next line should always be indented one level. If you try to use a control structure but don’t provide any statements in the body of the control structure, Python will throw an error.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, the <span class="literal">else:</span> clause cannot be present without at least one statement in the block. If there is no need for the <span class="literal">else</span>, just don’t include it. (If you really want to include it, use the <span class="literal">pass</span> keyword to indicate to Python that you know a statement needs to be there, but you really don’t want that condition to do anything.)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Indentation can seem intimidating to people new to Python, but you can make it easier on yourself by properly configuring your text editor. Python convention says that you should tell your text editor to do the following:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Insert spaces in place of tab characters. Shun tab characters like the plague.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Insert four spaces every time you hit the T A B key.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Automatically indent when you hit the E N T E R key.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<p class="indent">With these settings, when you enter the “:” of a control statement, just hit ENTER, and Python will indent the block automatically.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The way to configure these settings depends on the text editor used, of course, but any text editor worth its salt will be able to do all of these, and many have automatic indentation set as standard. If you use integrated development environments (IDEs), then it’s probable that once the IDE recognizes that you’re coding in Python, most of these conventions will just happen.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1_12">Variables and Basic Data Structures</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Python’s native data structures are simple and elegant. In this section, we’ll cover number representation, variables, strings, lists, and dictionaries.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_10">Representing Numbers</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Numbers in Python are of two kinds: integers or floating-point. <em>Integers</em> are whole numbers like 42 and 66. <em>Floating-point numbers</em> are those with a decimal point like 3.1415 and 2.718. We’ll ignore complex numbers in this book, although Python supports them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you don’t include a decimal point, Python will assume you mean an integer; otherwise, it will use floating-point numbers. Floating-point numbers can also be specified using scientific notation, where <span class="literal">6.022e23</span> means 6.023 × 10<sup>23</sup>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Most programming languages can represent only numbers in a certain range, but Python does not have this restriction for integers, which can be as <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"/>large as there is memory to hold them. For fun, enter <strong><span class="literal">2**2001</span></strong> and see what happens. The many ways in which computers store and operate on numbers is quite fascinating. Those who are curious might want to look further.<sup><a id="Rch02fn1" href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fn1">1</a></sup></p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_11">Variables</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Variables</em> provide a useful place to store data for reuse. Fortunately, using Python variables is straightforward. Python is <em>dynamically typed</em>, which means we don’t need to declare the type of data a variable will store in advance. We simply assign data to a variable, and Python figures out the type for us.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can even change the type of data stored in a variable by assigning a new value, regardless of its type. For example, all of these are valid assignments in Python:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">v = 123</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❷</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">n = 3.141592</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❸</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">v = 6.022e23</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The code assigns integer 123 to <span class="literal">v</span> <span class="ent">❶</span>, the floating-point value 3.141592 to <span class="literal">n</span> <span class="ent">❷</span>, and then reassigns a floating-point value to <span class="literal">v</span>: 6.022 × 10<sup>23</sup> <span class="ent">❸</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python variable names are case-sensitive, must start with a letter, and can include letters, numbers, and “_” (underscore) characters. Many Python programmers follow the camel-case convention of Java, shown here, but this is not strictly required:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">myVariableName=123</span></p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_12">Strings</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Python supports textual data with strings. You mark the beginning and end of <em>strings</em> with quotes, either single (’), double (’’), or triple (’’’), as long as you use the same for both opening and closing. The triple-quoted string is special: it can span multiple lines of text, and you would often use it immediately after defining a function to implement a simple documentation string. All of these are valid Python strings:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">thing1 = 'how now brown cow?'</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">thing2 = "I don't think; therefore I am not."</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">thing3 = """</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">one</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">two</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">three</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">"""</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here, <span class="literal">thing1</span> is a simple string; <span class="literal">thing2</span> is also a simple string, but note that it has a single quote embedded in it to act as an apostrophe. We can do this <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15"/>because we started the string with a double quote character; if we wanted to use double quotes inside the string, then we would have to enclose it with single quotes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The last string, <span class="literal">thing3</span>, spans multiple lines. The newline characters typed to move from <span class="literal">one</span> to <span class="literal">two</span> are also part of the string, and when printed, they will be shown. Note, if you actually enter the assignment to <span class="literal">thing3</span> in the Python interpreter, you will see that the interpreter inserts an ellipsis (<span class="literal">...</span>). We ignored those in the example as they would be confusing and are not really part of the string.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_13">Lists</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Strings and numbers are <em>primitive data types</em>, meaning they are not made up of grouped collections of data. Think of them as atoms. They can be combined into more sophisticated data structures by using tuples and lists. A <em>list</em> is an ordered collection of other data, which could be primitive data or any other collection of data. A list can hold lists, for example.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Basic List Operations</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Unlike with some other data types, the order in which items are appended to a list matters. Let’s just jump in with some examples of lists and then talk about what’s happening:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t = ["Quednoe","Biggles",39]</span><br/>&#13;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t</span><br/>&#13;
       ['Quednoe', 'Biggles', 39]<br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❷</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t[0]</span><br/>&#13;
      'Quednoe'<br/>&#13;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t[1]</span><br/>&#13;
      'Biggles'<br/>&#13;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t[2]</span><br/>&#13;
      39</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, we define a list <span class="ent">❶</span>. We use a “<span class="literal">[</span>” character to start the list, enter the items, and end with a “<span class="literal">]</span>” character. Items in the list are separated by commas (<span class="literal">,</span>). This list has three items, as we see when we ask Python to evaluate the expression <span class="literal">t</span>, which is the list itself.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can index into lists by using a number and square brackets, just as we would an array. Here we ask for the first item in the list using bracket notation <span class="ent">❷</span>. We do the same for the second and the third.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We can add to a list by using the <span class="literal">append</span> method:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t.append(3.14)</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t</span><br/>&#13;
    ['Quednoe', 'Biggles', 39, 3.14]</p>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here we see that the list, <span class="literal">t</span>, now has a fourth member, <span class="literal">3.14</span>. Note that appending an item to a list adds it to the <em>end</em> of the list.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"/>Let’s look at a few more examples with lists.</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t[-1]</span><br/>&#13;
       3.14<br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❷</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t[0:2]</span><br/>&#13;
       ['Quednoe', 'Biggles']<br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❸</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t[1] = 'Melvin'</span><br/>&#13;
   &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t</span><br/>&#13;
       ['Quednoe', 'Melvin', 39, 3.14]<br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❹</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">t.index("Melvin")</span><br/>&#13;
       1</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These examples show us how to use a negative index <span class="ent">❶</span>, which will start at the <em>end</em> of the list and count backward, so that <span class="literal">-1</span> will always return the last item in the list. We also see how to use a range to select a subset of the list <span class="ent">❷</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To use Python ranges, follow the format <span class="literal">[a:b]</span> to return all items from index <span class="literal">a</span> to <em>one less than</em> <span class="literal">b</span>. Mathematically this is [<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>), where the <em>b</em>-th item is not included. So, asking for <span class="literal">t[0:2]</span> will return items 0 and 1 only. Note, if you skip the beginning part or ending part of the range, it defaults to the first item (if the beginning is skipped) or the last item (if the ending is skipped).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you use an index on the left side of an assignment statement, that element of the list is modified <span class="ent">❸</span>. We now see that the second element of the list has changed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, we use the <span class="literal">index</span> method to search the list for an item <span class="ent">❹</span>. If the item is found, <span class="literal">index</span> returns the index of the item. If the item is not in the list, Python will raise an error.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you want to know if an item is in the list but do not care <em>where</em> it is, use <span class="literal">in</span>, like so:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">b = [1,2,3,4]</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">2 in b</span><br/>&#13;
    True<br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">5 in b</span><br/>&#13;
    False</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here the returned values are Booleans, <span class="literal">True</span> and <span class="literal">False</span>. Note the uppercase on <span class="literal">True</span> and <span class="literal">False</span>. Booleans can be assigned to variables as well. We should also mention <span class="literal">None</span>, which is Python’s version of <span class="literal">NULL</span> as found in other languages (at least to a first approximation). We’ll see a good use for <span class="literal">None</span> when we talk about Python functions in “Functions– on <a href="ch03.xhtml#page_39">page 39</a>.</p>&#13;
<h5 class="h5">Copying Lists</h5>&#13;
<p class="noindent">One last thing to note about lists is that Python does not copy lists when you assign them to new variables; instead, it points the new variable to the location in memory where the list already exists. For example:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">a = [0,1,2,3,4]</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">a</span><br/>&#13;
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]<br/>&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">b = a</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">b</span><br/>&#13;
     [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here we define <span class="literal">a</span> as a list of five numbers. We then assign that list to a new variable, <span class="literal">b</span>, and see that <span class="literal">b</span> is, indeed, the same as <span class="literal">a</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">So far, so good. However, what if we decide to change an element of <span class="literal">a</span> like so:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">a[2] = 3</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">a</span><br/>&#13;
    [0, 1, 3, 3, 4]<br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">b</span><br/>&#13;
    [0, 1, 3, 3, 4]</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We see that <span class="literal">a</span> has updated as we desired, but, perhaps surprisingly, so has <span class="literal">b</span>. This is because assigning <span class="literal">a</span> to <span class="literal">b</span> points <span class="literal">b</span> to the same place in memory as <span class="literal">a</span>. It does not actually copy the contents of <span class="literal">a</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If we want to copy <span class="literal">a</span> when we assign it to <span class="literal">b</span>, we need to explicitly select all the elements of <span class="literal">a</span> like this:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">b = a[:]</span><br/>&#13;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">a</span><br/>&#13;
      [0, 1, 3, 3, 4]<br/>&#13;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">b</span><br/>&#13;
      [0, 1, 3, 3, 4]<br/>&#13;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">a[2] = 2</span><br/>&#13;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">a</span><br/>&#13;
      [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]<br/>&#13;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">b</span><br/>&#13;
      [0, 1, 3, 3, 4]</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here we define a list, <span class="literal">a</span>, and then assign <span class="literal">a</span> to <span class="literal">b</span> by selecting all of the elements of <span class="literal">a</span> <span class="ent">❶</span>. We see that <span class="literal">b</span> now looks like <span class="literal">a</span>. Next, we update the <em>third</em> item in <span class="literal">a</span> and see that <span class="literal">a</span> now looks as we expect, with its third item now <span class="literal">2</span> instead of <span class="literal">3</span>. However, <span class="literal">b</span> has not been altered in this case because the original assignment created a new list in memory by selecting all the elements of <span class="literal">a</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The reason Python doesn’t automatically copy lists is that lists can be large, so copying them unnecessarily would waste a lot of memory. Completely copying a list made up of other, nested, lists can be nontrivial. The selecting everything method <span class="ent"><span class="ent">❶</span></span> makes only a shallow copy—nested elements are still aliased. Use the <span class="literal">deepcopy</span> function of the <span class="literal">copy</span> module to recursively copy all levels of a list with nested elements.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python has another data type similar to a list called a <em>tuple</em>. Tuples, defined with parentheses rather than square brackets, are just like lists except that once defined, they cannot be modified. In general, we will stick with lists, but NumPy uses tuples from time to time (see <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_14"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"/>Dictionaries</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The last data type we’ll look at is the <em>dictionary</em>. A dictionary is made up of a set of keys, each associated with a value. You define dictionaries with “<span class="literal">{</span>” and “<span class="literal">}</span>” characters. As with a list, the value can be anything, including another dictionary. They key is typically a string but can be a number or other object as well. You define a dictionary like so:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">d = {"a":1, "b":2, "c":3}</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">d.keys()</span><br/>&#13;
    dict_keys(['a', 'b', 'c'])</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This example shows how to define the dictionary by directly listing its contents. The elements of the dictionary are given as key:value pairs. Here, the keys are all strings, and the value associated with each key is an integer. The <span class="literal">keys</span> method returns all the keys in the dictionary.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The syntax above is useful when the contents of the dictionary are already known. Typically, this isn’t the case. Most of the time, the dictionary is defined, and we add elements individually:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">d = {}</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">d["a"] = 1</span> <br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">d["b"] = 2</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">d["c"] = 3</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here we define an empty dictionary <span class="literal">d</span>, and individually assign values for a new set of keys. If the key already exists in the dictionary <span class="literal">d</span>, its value is updated.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To get the value associated with a particular key, just index the dictionary with the key:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">d["b"]</span><br/>&#13;
    2</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If the key doesn’t exist in that dictionary, Python will raise an error. To test if a key is in the dictionary, use <span class="literal">in</span>, like so:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">"c" in d</span><br/>&#13;
    True</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Between lists and dictionaries, you can conveniently store almost any data. This is one of the benefits of a language like Python: programmers can devote energy to completing the task at hand instead of implementing complicated data structures. Lists and dictionaries are fast to use and generally all you’ll need unless you’re doing scientific programming, in which case we have NumPy, as discussed in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1_13"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19"/>Control Structures</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Python implements several <em>control structures</em> to allow you to alter program flow using syntax. We’ll look at these:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="literal">if</span>-<span class="literal">elif</span>-<span class="literal">else</span></li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="literal">for</span> loops</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="literal">while</span> loops</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="literal">with</span> statements</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span class="literal">try</span>-<span class="literal">except</span> blocks</li>&#13;
</ul>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_15">if-elif-else Statements</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">An <span class="literal">if</span> statement makes a decision. You give it a condition that must result in a Boolean value, <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span>. If the condition is true, the first block of the <span class="literal">if</span> statement is executed. If the condition is false, nothing happens and the code moves past the <span class="literal">if</span> statement, unless you include an <span class="literal">else</span>, in which case the body of the <span class="literal">else</span> will be executed. You can test multiple conditions in one statement by using the <span class="literal">elif</span> keyword, which adds additional conditions with their own blocks of code to run. For example:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">disc = b**2 - 4*a*c</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❷</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">if (disc &lt; 0):</span><br/>&#13;
          <span class="codestrong1">print("imaginary")</span><br/>&#13;
    <span class="ent">❸</span> <span class="codestrong1">elif (disc == 0):</span><br/>&#13;
          <span class="codestrong1">print("single real")</span><br/>&#13;
       <span class="codestrong1">else:</span><br/>&#13;
         <span class="ent">❹</span> <span class="codestrong1">print("two real")</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This checks the discriminant of a quadratic polynomial, <em>ax</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>bx</em> + <em>c</em>, to identify the number and type of solution: a real number, a pair of real numbers, or imaginary numbers. The solutions are the values of <em>x</em> that make the polynomial equal to zero.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, the code calculates the discriminant value (<span class="literal">disc</span>) <span class="ent">❶</span>. It then asks if the value is less than zero <span class="ent">❷</span>. If it is, it means there are two imaginary solutions. If the discriminant is exactly zero <span class="ent">❸</span>, there’s only one solution, a real number. Finally, the <span class="literal">else</span> executes if neither of the conditions is true; in this case, it means there are two real-number solutions <span class="ent">❹</span>. The parentheses around the conditions are not required but can help with readability. Also note that Python uses “<span class="literal">**</span>” for exponentiation so that <span class="literal">b**2-4*a*c</span> = <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> <em>–</em> 4<em>ac</em>. You can use as many <span class="literal">elif</span> clauses as needed, including none, followed by an optional final <span class="literal">else</span>. Python lacks the <span class="literal">case</span> or <span class="literal">switch</span> statements found in other common programming languages.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_16">for Loops</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Almost all structured programming languages have loops to run a particular block of code repeatedly. In this section, we’ll cover a few kinds in Python.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"/>Python’s primary looping construct is the <span class="literal">for</span> loop. In other languages, typically <span class="literal">for</span> loops are counted loops from some starting value to an ending value that increments by some fixed amount. In Python, loops run over objects that can be iterated through, things that have a <span class="literal">next</span> method. This includes the characters of a string, the elements of a list or tuple, or the elements of a dictionary.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python has two built-in functions that are quite handy with loops. The first is <span class="literal">range</span>, which creates a generator object that produces integers in order, starting with <span class="literal">0</span> unless otherwise specified:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">for i in range(6):</span><br/>&#13;
         <span class="codestrong1">print(i)</span><br/>&#13;
  0<br/>&#13;
  1<br/>&#13;
  2<br/>&#13;
  3<br/>&#13;
  4<br/>&#13;
  5</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">range</span> function <span class="ent"><span class="ent">❶</span></span> returns the values <span class="literal">0...5</span>, and the <span class="literal">for</span> statement assigns the values one at a time to <span class="literal">i</span> for each iteration of the loop. Here we simply print the current value of <span class="literal">i</span> using the built-in Python function, <span class="literal">print</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Another useful function to use with <span class="literal">for</span> loops is <span class="literal">enumerate</span>. This function returns two values. The first is the index of the current element of its argument and the second is the element itself. An example will clarify:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x = ["how","now","brown","cow"]</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">for i in x:</span> <span class="ent">❶</span><br/>&#13;
      <span class="codestrong1">print(i)</span><br/>&#13;
how<br/>&#13;
now<br/>&#13;
brown<br/>&#13;
cow<br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">for i,v in enumerate(x):</span> <span class="ent">❷</span><br/>&#13;
      <span class="codestrong1">print(i,v)</span><br/>&#13;
0 how<br/>&#13;
1 now<br/>&#13;
2 brown<br/>&#13;
3 cow</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the first loop over just the list <span class="literal">x</span> <span class="ent">❶</span>, we get each element of <span class="literal">x</span> assigned to <span class="literal">i</span> for each iteration. The second loop uses <span class="literal">enumerate</span> and gives us <em>two</em> values for each iteration: the current index, stored in <span class="literal">i</span>, and the current element of the list <span class="literal">x</span>, stored in <span class="literal">v</span> <span class="ent">❷</span>. Python is capable of assigning multiple parts to multiple variables at the same time. In this case, the loop body prints the index followed by the element at that index.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21"/>What happens when we use a <span class="literal">for</span> loop with a dictionary? Let’s see:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">d = {"a":1, "b":2, "c":2.718}</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❷</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">for i in d:</span><br/>&#13;
         <span class="codestrong1">print(i)</span><br/>&#13;
  a<br/>&#13;
  b<br/>&#13;
  c<br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❸</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">for i in d:</span><br/>&#13;
         <span class="codestrong1">print(i, d[i])</span><br/>&#13;
  a 1<br/>&#13;
  b 2<br/>&#13;
  c 2.718</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here we first define a dictionary, <span class="literal">d</span>, with three keys <span class="ent">❶</span>. If we simply loop over the dictionary variable, we will be given the keys <span class="ent">❷</span>. However, if we then use the key to return the associated value, as in the second loop <span class="ent">❸</span>, we’ll iterate over the entire dictionary, accessing each value exactly once.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">One particularly attractive feature of Python is that we can combine a <span class="literal">for</span> loop with a list in a <em>list comprehension</em>. A list comprehension starts out as a list with a leading “<span class="literal">[</span>”, but instead of listing the individual elements, the body of the list is actually code that generates the list. This shorthand takes a bit of getting used to, but once you’re familiar with it, you’ll see that it’s an efficient replacement for many <span class="literal">for</span> loops. For example:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">import random</span><br/>&#13;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">a = []</span><br/>&#13;
  &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">for i in range(10000):</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❷</span>         <span class="codestrong1">a.append(random.random())</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❸</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">b = [random.random() for i in range(10000)]</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❹</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">m3 = [i for i in range(10000) if (i % 3) == 0]</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We first import the standard random number library <span class="ent"><span class="ent">❶</span></span> and then fill the list <span class="literal">a</span> with 10,000 random numbers in the range [0,1) (meaning 0 is included, 1 is not) <span class="ent">❷</span>. Next, we also fill <span class="literal">b</span> with 10,000 random numbers but do so using a list comprehension <span class="ent">❸</span>. Note that the syntax is the same as when we define a list with values, but here the body of the list is something that <em>returns</em> a value. In this case, it’s a call to <span class="literal">random.random()</span> and a <span class="literal">for</span> loop over 10,000 elements.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The last example creates a list, <span class="literal">m3</span>, of all multiples of 3, including 0, less than 10,000 <span class="ent">❹</span>. The <span class="literal">if</span> clause is the test that decides whether a particular <span class="literal">i</span> value will be in the list. The percent operator is <em>modulo</em>, which gives the remainder after division. In this case, it’s asking if the remainder after dividing <span class="literal">i</span> by 3, using integer division, is zero. If it is, there is no remainder, which means <span class="literal">i</span> is a multiple of 3 (or 0).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_17"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22"/>while Loops</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Many programming languages include both top-tested and bottom-tested loops. A <em>top-tested loop</em> tests the loop condition at the beginning, before executing any of the body, and if the test is not true, the body is never executed. A <em>bottom-tested loop</em> executes the body at least once and <em>then</em> tests to see if the loop should execute again. The <span class="literal">while</span> loop in C is a top-tested loop and the <span class="literal">do...while</span> loop is a bottom-tested loop. Python has only a top-tested <span class="literal">while</span> loop with the following syntax:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">i = 0</span><br/>&#13;
<span class="ent">❷</span> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">while (i &lt; 4):</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">print(i)</span><br/>&#13;
      <span class="ent">❸</span> <span class="codestrong1">i += 1</span><br/>&#13;
  0<br/>&#13;
  1<br/>&#13;
  2<br/>&#13;
  3</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We have to initialize the loop control variable (<span class="literal">i</span>) with a 0 <em>before</em> we start the loop <span class="ent"><span class="ent">❶</span></span> so that the condition <span class="literal">i &lt; 4</span> is true to begin with <span class="ent">❷</span>. Also note that we explicitly increment <span class="literal">i</span> at the end of the body of the loop <span class="ent">❸</span>. The expression <span class="literal">i += 1</span> is shorthand for <span class="literal">i = i + 1</span> and increments <span class="literal">i</span> by 1. Python doesn’t support C-style increment and decrement such as <span class="literal">i ++</span>. If you try it, Python will kindly let you know with a <span class="literal">SyntaxError</span>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">while</span> loop repeats as long as the condition evaluates to <span class="literal">True</span>. It’s up to the programmer to do things in the loop body that will eventually make the condition <span class="literal">False</span> so the loop will end. You can also manually exit the loop, as you’ll see in the following section.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_18">break and continue Statements</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The <span class="literal">for</span> and <span class="literal">while</span> loops work with two other Python statements: to immediately exit the loop, use the <span class="literal">break</span> statement; to immediately move to the next iteration, use <span class="literal">continue</span>. One common use of <span class="literal">break</span> is to leave an infinite loop:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">i = 0</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">while True:</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">print(i)</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">i += 1</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">if (i == 4):</span><br/>&#13;
         <span class="ent">❶</span> <span class="codestrong1">break</span><br/>&#13;
0<br/>&#13;
1<br/>&#13;
2<br/>&#13;
3</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_23"/>This produces the same output as the earlier <span class="literal">while</span> loop example, but exits the loop explicitly via <span class="literal">break</span> when the termination condition is met <span class="ent">❶</span>; here, that’s when <span class="literal">i</span> is incremented up to 4. Using <span class="literal">break</span> for this toy example does not really make sense since there are other, clearer ways to do this, but often the loop might need to execute until the program ends or until some other rare situation or error occurs. For example, the command line interpreter will keep checking for keyboard input. As each character comes in, it is added to a buffer. However, if the character is a “newline,” it breaks out of the loop and interprets the contents of the buffer.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">continue</span> statement iterates the loop without executing any body statements after it. For example:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">for i in range(4):</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">print(i)</span><br/>&#13;
     <span class="ent">❶</span> <span class="codestrong1">continue</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">print("xyzzy")</span><br/>&#13;
0<br/>&#13;
1<br/>&#13;
2<br/>&#13;
3</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here the presence of <span class="literal">continue</span> <span class="ent"><span class="ent">❶</span></span> ensures that the second <span class="literal">print</span> statement is never executed.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_19">with Statement</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The Python <span class="literal">with</span> statement is useful when dealing with files. For example, the following code uses a <span class="literal">with</span> statement to open a file on disk and read its contents into a string:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">with open("sesame") as f:</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">s = f.read()</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">s</span><br/>&#13;
'this is a file\n'</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">with</span> statement opens a file called <em>sesame</em> and assigns the file object to <span class="literal">f</span>. We then use the <span class="literal">read</span> method to read the entire file as a string and assign it to <span class="literal">s</span>. Evaluating <span class="literal">s</span> shows us that the file contains the string “this is a file” with a newline character at the end.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Note that the example above uses <span class="literal">open</span> and <span class="literal">read</span> but doesn’t explicitly close the file when done. This is because when the <span class="literal">with</span> statement exits, the <span class="literal">close</span> method is called automatically as <span class="literal">f</span> leaves scope (meaning <span class="literal">f</span> is defined only within the body of the <span class="literal">with</span> statement).</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="lev2_20"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24"/>Handling Errors with try-except Blocks</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Finally, let’s take a quick look at Python’s ability to trap and process errors, rather than let errors halt our programs. Again, we’ll just look at a quick skeleton of Python’s error-control abilities as an aid to debugging.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To capture an error instead of letting it stop program execution, we can encapsulate the statements that might cause the error with a <span class="literal">try...except</span> block. If an error is raised by any of the statements after the <span class="literal">try</span> and before the <span class="literal">except</span>, it will be caught and execution will pass to the statements of the <span class="literal">except</span> clause. The example here shows how to catch <em>any</em> error that happens within the statements enclosed by the <span class="literal">try</span> block; though it’s useful to know that Python has a rich set of error types, and users can define their own:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x = 1.0/0.0</span><br/>&#13;
Traceback (most recent call last):<br/>&#13;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;<br/>&#13;
ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero<br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">try:</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">x = 1.0/0.0</span><br/>&#13;
    <span class="codestrong1">except:</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">x = 0</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x</span><br/>&#13;
0</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here we first attempt to assign the result of a division by zero to <span class="literal">x</span>. This fails with the given error message from Python. However, if we wrap the assignment in a <span class="literal">try</span> block, Python will move to the <span class="literal">x = 0</span> line of the <span class="literal">except</span> block and assign <span class="literal">x = 0</span> as shown.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re not using a sophisticated Python programming environment that supports breaks while executing code, the following construct is useful, as it halts execution when encountered. Here it halts execution immediately after the divide-by-zero error occurs:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">try:</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">x = 1.0/0.0</span><br/>&#13;
    <span class="codestrong1">except:</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When an error occurs, the <span class="literal">pdb</span> module will be imported, if it hasn’t been already, and the <span class="literal">set_trace</span> function will be called to enter into a debugging environment. Of course, <span class="literal">pdb.set_trace()</span> can be called at any point in the code—it need not be inside of a <span class="literal">try...except</span> block.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1_14">Functions</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You define a function in Python with the <span class="literal">def</span> keyword followed by the function name and a list of arguments the function will take in parentheses. Even if you include no arguments, you must include a pair of parentheses. Since Python is dynamically typed, you list the parameters of the function <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_25"/>but no type information. You can, if necessary, also include default values. Again, we are ignoring Python’s object-oriented abilities and just focusing on a small section of what we can do with functions. Let’s define a simple function:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs"> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">def product(a,b):</span><br/>&#13;
      <span class="codestrong1">return a*b</span><br/>&#13;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">product(4,5)</span><br/>&#13;
    20</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">This function is called <span class="literal">product</span> and it accepts two arguments that we will refer to in the function as <span class="literal">a</span> and <span class="literal">b</span>. The body of this function consists of a single statement—a <span class="literal">return</span> statement, which returns to the point in the code where <span class="literal">product</span> was called with the given value, here the product of the two arguments. If we test this function, then we see that it does indeed multiply its arguments.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, let’s redefine <span class="literal">product</span> and supply a default value for the second argument using the following code:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">def product(a,b=3):</span><br/>&#13;
        <span class="codestrong1">return a*b</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">product(4,5)</span><br/>&#13;
    20<br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">product(3)</span><br/>&#13;
    9</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We supply default values in the argument list of the function. If we use two arguments, Python will assign the value of the second argument inside the function as before. However, if we do not supply a second argument, Python will use the given default value of 3, giving us a meaningful return value of 3 × 3 = 9. Supplying a default value to a function argument makes it a keyword parameter, and, as we see above, we do not need to supply a value for that argument when we invoke the function. This technique is particularly handy, and we will see it in our code examples from time to time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Our final example below shows how to define a function that accepts no arguments:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">def pp():</span><br/>&#13;
      <span class="codestrong1">print("plugh")</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">pp()</span><br/>&#13;
    <span class="codestrong1">plugh</span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The function <span class="literal">pp</span> has an empty argument list. The only statement in the body of the function prints the word <em>plugh</em>. There is no return value.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python allows you to nest function definitions so that a function can itself have functions defined within it. The inner functions are accessible to only the outer function. There is seldom a need to do this, and if you find yourself doing it often, you might want to think about refactoring to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_26"/>an object-oriented design; but, on occasion, it makes sense, so we mention it here.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, one helpful thing to do is to make the default value <span class="literal">None</span>, enabling us inside the function to check whether the value was given by testing if the argument is <span class="literal">None</span>. Any variable holding any type of data can be tested against <span class="literal">None</span>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1_15">Modules</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We conclude our whirlwind review of Python with a look at the module system. This is akin to the C standard library, and it provides Python with a rich set of tools out of the box, all defined as modules. Naturally, users can create their own modules as well. A <em>module</em>, then, is a collection of functions that can be imported into your program. You can also import specific functions from a specific module into your own program, rather than the whole module, as long as you’re aware of the possibility that the imported function might have the same name as a function from another namespace.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">By <em>namespace</em>, we mean a bag of functions, sort of like a family, where the functions are the names of the individuals in the family. All the functions that our program knows about are in our namespace. If we import a function from a module, that function is now also in our namespace. If we import the entire module and refer to the function by prefixing the module name, we get to use the function, but it’s not in our namespace. We’ll see shortly why this distinction matters.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s see some examples using the modules of the Python library:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">import time</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">time.time()</span><br/>&#13;
    1524693601.402852</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We first import the <span class="literal">time</span> module. This means that we now have access to all the functions in the <span class="literal">time</span> module as long as we prefix the function name with <span class="literal">time.</span>. The <span class="literal">time</span> function of the <span class="literal">time</span> module returns the current time as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. Known as the <em>epoch time</em>, this is useful for timing how long code takes to execute. Because the value returned only increases, the difference in epoch time at the start of the code to the end of the code indicates the length of time for code execution.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s look at another example:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">from time import ctime, localtime</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">ctime()</span><br/>&#13;
    'Wed Apr 25 16:00:21 2020'<br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">localtime().tm_year</span><br/>&#13;
    2018</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here, instead of importing the entire <span class="literal">time</span> module, we import only two functions from it. Doing this puts the functions in our namespace so that we can call them directly. The <span class="literal">ctime</span> function returns a string showing the current date and time, while the <span class="literal">localtime</span> function returns the sections of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_27"/>the current time broken down by date and time part. Here we show the year at the time of this writing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Our last example shows us why it is often best to import a module directly instead of importing functions from it:</p>&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">def sqrt(x):</span><br/>&#13;
      <span class="codestrong1">return 4</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">sqrt(2)</span><br/>&#13;
    4<br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">from math import *</span><br/>&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">sqrt(2)</span><br/>&#13;
    1.4142135623730951</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">First, we define a function we call <span class="literal">sqrt</span>. This function always returns 4 no matter what the argument is. Not particularly useful, of course, but still a valid Python function.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, let’s import the entire <span class="literal">math</span> library of functions. This syntax takes all the functions in the module and places them in our namespace so we can refer to them without using the module name as well. After doing this, we see that <span class="literal">sqrt</span> now returns the actual square root.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">What happened to our dubious implementation of <span class="literal">sqrt</span>? It was masked when we imported the entire <span class="literal">math</span> library because the <span class="literal">math</span> library also contains a function called <span class="literal">sqrt</span> and, since the <span class="literal">math</span> library was imported after our <span class="literal">sqrt</span> was defined, the <span class="literal">math</span> library’s version of <span class="literal">sqrt</span> takes precedence.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python’s module library is one of the key strengths of the language in terms of utility. The standard library has extensive documentation. For a quick look at the list of available Python 3.<em>X</em> modules, see <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html">https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html</a></em>. The main Python site is here: <a href="http://www.python.org/">http://www.python.org/</a>. I strongly recommend that you spend some time at these links and really learn all that Python has to offer.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev1_16">Summary</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, we reviewed the fundamentals of Python to give us the background we need to understand the code examples in the remainder of this book. We learned about Python syntax and statements. We also examined Python variables and data structures, and then explored Python’s suite of control structures and functions, ending with a look at Python’s module library.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the next chapter, we’ll dive into NumPy to see how to make Python even more useful to us. NumPy is a core piece of the machine learning toolkit used by virtually all machine learning libraries, including the ones we will use in this book.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_28"/></p>&#13;
