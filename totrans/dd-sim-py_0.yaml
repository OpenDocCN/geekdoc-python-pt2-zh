- en: Python is a unique language. As a software developer, I have come to appreciate
    it for its particularities. There is a certain artistic beauty about a well-written
    Python program. I love when I find the most “Pythonic” solution to a problem and
    then look back and wonder how I thought any other answer would do.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Unfortunately, for years, I was crippled by an instinctual desire to view Python
    through the lens of the other languages I knew. Although I could read and write
    in Python, I failed to see the “obviousness” of a particular practice. It was
    like trying to speak Spanish using only a translation dictionary. I could write
    Python, but I couldn’t really *think* in Python. The essential qualities of the
    language were lost on me.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once I started to truly understand Python—to think in it—I found a new delight
    in the language. Solutions became obvious. Design was a joy, rather than an enigma.

- en: When a brand-new developer cuts their teeth on Python, they have few preconceptions.
    They have no “native tongue” to hamper their introduction to the language. But
    for an established developer who picks up Python as a second or third language,
    the transition is in some ways far rougher. They must not only learn something
    new, but in many ways, they must *unlearn* something old.

- en: If you are already familiar with another programming language and now wish to
    learn Python for the first time, without slogging through beginner-oriented courses,
    this book is for you. I’ll be focusing specifically on the “Pythonic” way of doing
    things, with minimal, targeted explanations of the underlying general programming
    concepts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you’re an intermediate-level Python developer, you’ll also find this book
    useful. Although I’ve been working with Python for many years myself, some of
    these topics didn’t “click” for me until more recently. This book gives the explanations
    I wish I’d gotten.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you don’t already know programming, despair not. There are hundreds of excellent
    books and resources for learning Python as a first programming language. I particularly
    recommend either *Python Crash Course,* 2nd Edition, by Eric Matthes (No Starch
    Press, 2019) or *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python,* 2nd Edition, by Al Sweigart
    (No Starch Press, 2019). Afterward, you can return to this book to reinforce and
    expand upon your newfound knowledge.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When I titled this book *Dead Simple Python*, I was describing a retrospective
    view of the topics, rather than a forward-looking one. One should recognize that
    any topic worth learning, when first approached, will feel insurmountable. Similarly,
    any explanation worthy of an existing software developer should possess enough
    depth to utterly disqualify it from the forward-looking label of “simple.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead, I aim to unpack each topic in such a manner that, by the conclusion
    of the section, the reader cannot help but feel the concept is altogether obvious.
    Regardless of the topic’s initial appearance of complexity, the reader should
    be ultimately left with an impression that it is actually “dead simple,” at which
    point, they may be assured they are thinking like a native Python developer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To achieve this level of understanding, I generally start by unpacking the lowest-level,
    most explicit form of the topic. Once that is established, I add layer upon layer,
    ultimately reaching the implicit, idiomatic form most commonly used. In this way,
    I hope to help you, the reader, come away with a solid, comfortable understanding
    of precisely why and how each feature of the language works.

    your new knowledge to live projects more readily.'

- en: What’s NOT in This Book
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since this book is intended for existing programmers, I won’t be rehashing much
    general theory. Readers should already know (from a language-agnostic standpoint)
    what variables and functions are, what the difference is between classes and objects,
    and so forth. At most, I’ll briefly define those concepts that aren’t quite ubiquitous
    in the programming world.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: My discussion of topics is far from exhaustive. I’m focusing more on the *why*
    and *how*, thereby providing a strong foundation. Readers are encouraged to broaden
    their understanding through additional, independent reading, so I’ll leave the
    comprehensive listing of library functions and the like to the documentation.
    Many popular features in the standard library, such as random numbers and datetime
    operations, are afforded little more than incidental explanation when they’re
    used in an example.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To control the scope of this book, I also won’t be covering most third-party
    tools and libraries. I am frequently asked to discuss popular alternatives to
    the default tools in Python, but as these alternatives fall in and out of favor
    like the passing of the seasons, I will be sticking largely to the universal defaults.
    There are scattered exceptions, but only when a third-party tool has become practically
    ubiquitous in the ecosystem, eclipsing even the standard library.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    refer the reader to its official documentation or website.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Dead Simple Python* is intended more as a guided tour than a desk reference.
    I recommend starting here, at the beginning, and working your way through the
    chapters, in order. Whether you’re new to the language or have been trying to
    use it for a while without feeling like you “get it,” you’ll discover that this
    approach will fill in many knowledge gaps you never realized you had.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, if you know of a particular topic you need a better understanding of
    *right now*, you can skip directly to the chapter that deals with it. Most chapters
    are written to stand alone, but I will always assume that you have read and understand
    the material in the preceding chapters.

- en: About the Vocabulary
  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nearly any Python book or online article uses vocabulary borrowed from other
    languages, such as words like *element*, *body*, and *variable*. While this is
    often assumed to be helpful because it relates Python concepts to readers’ existing
    knowledge, I believe borrowing such vocabulary is ultimately counterproductive.
    Attempting to understand Python primarily in terms of other languages frustrates
    many attempts to write clear, idiomatic code. What’s more, if one gets in the
    habit of using the wrong vocabulary, one will find the official documentation
    profoundly difficult to read.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, I’ve decided to adhere doggedly to the official vocabulary, even
    if a majority of the community considers an approximate synonym acceptable. This
    may be one of the few books in print that takes this position, but I consider
    it important. To become a native, you must learn to speak the local dialect!

    with pure functional programming.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To bridge these gaps, I provide occasional *Theory Recaps*, brief overviews
    of the essential theory and best practices related to certain programming paradigms
    and patterns. That way, if you already know a particular concept, you can skip
    over the Theory Recap and get right to the Python-specific stuff.

    went into this book.'

    particular note in the text about debates that never reached a satisfactory conclusion.

    realistic (if simplified) use cases for whatever topic I’m discussing. In many

    that tutorials often gloss over. I’ve made an effort to point out all the times
    my examples get a bit convoluted, but you should know that I may oversimplify
    or otherwise tiptoe around anything irrelevant to the immediate topic.

    after the section, so section `:2b` would revise section `:2a`; the revisions
