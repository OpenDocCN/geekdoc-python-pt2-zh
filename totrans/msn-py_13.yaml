- en: This appendix shows the final listing for the *Escape* game. You can use it
    as a reference to see where to place particular functions and sections, or read
    through it if you want to see the whole listing in one place. This listing doesn’t
    include the temporary sections you wrote while building the game, such as the
    `EXPLORER` section. It just contains the code that is in the final game.

    which lets you search it by pressing CTRL-F.

- en: I’ve changed `PLAYER_NAME` to “Captain” in this listing. When you’re building
    or customizing the game, you can use your own name (see ➊ in [Listing 4-1](ch04.xhtml#ch04list1)
    on [page 63](ch04.xhtml#page_63)).

    This game listing has been copied from game code that has been tested to completion
    on Windows, the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, and the Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.
