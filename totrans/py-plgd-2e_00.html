<p class="pf">Welcome to the second edition of <i>Python Playground</i>! Within these pages, you’ll find 15 exciting projects designed to encourage you to explore the world of programming with Python. The projects cover a wide range of topics, such as drawing Spirograph-like patterns, 3D rendering, projecting laser patterns in sync with music, and speech recognition using machine learning. In addition to being fun in and of themselves, these projects offer a lot of room for expansion and are designed to be jumping-off points for you to explore your own ideas.</p>

<p class="paft"><i>Python Playground</i> was written for anyone curious about how to use programming to understand and explore ideas. The projects in this book assume that you know basic Python syntax and basic programming concepts and that you’re familiar with high school mathematics. I’ve done my best to explain in detail the math you need for all projects.</p>
<p>This book isn’t intended to be your first book on Python. I won’t walk you through the basics. I will, however, show you how to use Python to solve a variety of real-world problems in a series of nontrivial projects. As you work through the projects, you’ll explore the nuances of the Python programming language and learn how to work with some popular Python libraries. But perhaps even more important, you’ll learn how to break down a problem into parts, develop an algorithm to solve that problem, and then implement a solution from the ground up using Python.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to solve real-world problems because they are often open-ended and require expertise in various domains. But Python offers the tools to facilitate problem-solving. Overcoming difficulties and finding solutions to real problems are the most important parts of your journey on the way to becoming an expert programmer.</p>

<h2 class="ah" id="ahintro03"><a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0008.xhtml#rahintro03">What’s New to the Second Edition?</a></h2>
<p class="paft">This second edition features five new projects, including the Koch snowflake project in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0012.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a> and the 3D version of Conway’s Game of Life in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0024.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>. The most significant updates are in the hardware section, which has been streamlined to focus exclusively on Raspberry Pi–based systems, rather than a mix of Raspberry Pi and Arduino. As such, every project in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0026.xhtml#pt05">Part V</a> either is new (<a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0027.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>, <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0029.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a>, <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0030.xhtml#ch15">Chapter 15</a>) or has been thoroughly redesigned (<a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0028.xhtml#ch13">Chapter 13</a>).</p>
<p><span aria-label=" Page xxiv. " class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pxxiv" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Relying just on Raspberry Pi simplifies the setup process for the hardware projects, and it keeps the book’s focus on Python programming. There’s no longer a need to switch between Python and code written in the Arduino programming language (a version of C++). With the updated <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0026.xhtml#pt05">Part V</a>, you’ll also get a taste for programming with MicroPython and CircuitPython, two flavors of Python optimized for running on resource-constrained embedded systems.</p>
<p>Other significant updates to the second edition include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li class="blf">• Using <code>pyaudio</code> rather than <code>pygame</code> to play WAV files in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0016.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a></li>
<li class="bl">• Comparing the performance of a linear search algorithm and a k-d tree data structure when finding the best image matches for the photomosaic in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0020.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a></li>
<li class="bl">• Guidance on how to create your own depth maps for generating autostereograms in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0021.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a></li>
<li class="bll">• Streamlined installation instructions in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0031.xhtml#appa">Appendix A</a> using the standard Anaconda Distribution of Python</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond these specific updates, the entire text has been reviewed, corrected, and clarified, and the code has been updated as needed to reflect changes to Python since the first edition was released.</p>

<h2 class="ah" id="ahintro04"><a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0008.xhtml#rahintro04">Why Python?</a></h2>
<p class="paft">Python is an ideal language for exploring programming. As a multiparadigm language, it provides you with a lot of flexibility in how you structure your programs. You can use Python as a <span class="idx" data-term="scripting language"/><i>scripting</i> language to simply execute code, as a <span class="idx" data-term="procedural language"/><i>procedural</i> language to organize your program into a collection of functions that call one another, or as an <span class="idx" data-term="object-oriented language"/><i>object-oriented</i> language that uses classes, inheritance, and modules to build up a hierarchy. This flexibility allows you to choose the programming style most suited to a particular project.</p>
<p>When you develop using a more traditional language like C or C++, you have to compile and link your code before you can run it. With Python, you can run it directly after editing. (Under the hood, Python compiles your code into an intermediate <span class="idx" data-term="bytecode"/>bytecode that is then run by the Python interpreter, but these processes are transparent to you, the user.) In practice, the process of modifying and running your code over and over is much less cumbersome with Python.</p>
<p>Python has a very small set of simple and powerful data structures. If you already understand strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, list comprehensions, and basic control structures such as <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> loops, you’re off to a great start. Python’s succinct and expressive syntax makes it easy to do complex operations with just a few lines of code. And once you’re familiar with Python’s built-in and third-party modules, you’ll have an arsenal of tools to tackle real problems like the ones covered in this book. There are standard ways to call C/C++ code from Python and vice versa, and because you can <span aria-label=" Page xxv. " class="page" epub:type="pagebreak" id="pxxv" role="doc-pagebreak"/>find libraries to do almost anything in Python, it’s easy to combine Python with other language modules in bigger projects. This is why Python is considered a great <span class="idx" data-term="glue language"/><i>glue</i> language—it makes it easy to combine diverse software components. The 3D graphics projects in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0022.xhtml#pt04">Part IV</a> demonstrate how Python can work side by side with the C-like OpenGL Shading Language, and in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0029.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a> you’ll even mix in a little bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a web interface for your IoT garden monitor. Real software projects often use a mix of software technologies, and Python fits very well into such layered architectures.</p>
<p>Python also provides a handy tool in the form of the Python interpreter. It lets you easily check code syntax, do quick computations, and even test code under development. When I write Python code, I keep three windows open: a text editor, a shell, and a Python <span class="idx" data-term="Python interpreter"/>interpreter. As I develop code in the editor, I import my functions or classes into the interpreter and test them as I go.</p>
<p>I also use the interpreter to get a feel for new modules before I incorporate them into my code. For example, while developing code for the IoT garden project in <a class="xref" href="nsp-venkitachalam503045-0029.xhtml#ch14">Chapter 14</a>, I wanted to test the <code>sqlite3</code> database module. I brought up the Python interpreter and tried the following to make sure I understood how to create and add entries to a database:</p>
<div class="codeline1">
<p class="cl1f">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">import sqlite3</code></p>
<p class="cl1">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">con = sqlite3.connect('test.db')</code></p>
<p class="cl1">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">cur = con.cursor()</code></p>
<p class="cl1">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">cur.execute("CREATE TABLE sensor_data (TS datetime, ID text, VAL numeric)")</code></p>
<p class="cl1">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">for i in range(10):</code></p>
<p class="cl1">...   <code class="b">cur.execute("INSERT into sensor_data VALUES (datetime('now'),'ABC', ?)", (i, ))</code></p>
<p class="cl1">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">con.commit()</code></p>
<p class="cl1">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">con.close()</code></p>
<p class="cl1l">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">exit()</code></p>
</div>
<p>Then, to make sure it worked, I did the following to retrieve some of the data I added:</p>
<div class="codeline">
<p class="clf">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">con = sqlite3.connect('test.db')</code></p>
<p class="cl">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">cur = con.cursor()</code></p>
<p class="cl">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">cur.execute("SELECT * FROM sensor_data WHERE VAL &gt; 5")</code></p>
<p class="cl">&gt;&gt;&gt; <code class="b">print(cur.fetchall())</code></p>
<p class="cl">[('2021-10-16 13:01:22', 'ABC', 6), ('2021-10-16 13:01:22', 'ABC', 7),</p>
<p class="cll"> ('2021-10-16 13:01:22', 'ABC', 8), ('2021-10-16 13:01:22', 'ABC', 9)]</p>
</div>
<p>This example demonstrates the practical use of the Python interpreter as a powerful tool for development. You don’t need to write a complete program to do quick experiments; just open up the interpreter and get going. This is just one of the many reasons why I love Python and why I think you will too.</p>
