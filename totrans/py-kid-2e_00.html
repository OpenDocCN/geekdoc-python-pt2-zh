<p class="indent">Why learn computer programming? Programming fosters creativity, reasoning, and problem solving. The programmer gets the opportunity to create something from nothing, use logic to turn programming constructs into a form that a computer can run, and, when things don’t work quite as well as expected, use problem solving to figure out what has gone wrong. Programming is a fun, sometimes challenging (and occasionally frustrating) activity, and the skills learned from it can be useful both in school and at work—even if your career has nothing to do <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/>with computers. And, if nothing else, programming is a great way to spend an afternoon when the weather outside is dreary.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec1">Why Python</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Python is an easy-to-learn programming language that has some really useful features for a beginning programmer. The code is quite easy to read when compared to other programming languages, and it has an interactive shell into which you can enter your programs and see them run.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In addition to its simple language structure and an interactive shell with which to experiment, Python has some features that greatly augment the learning process and allow you to put together simple animations for creating your own games. One is the <span class="literal">turtle</span> module, inspired by Turtle graphics (used by the Logo programming language back in the 1960s) and designed for educational use. Another is the <span class="literal">tkinter</span> module, an interface for the Tk graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit, which provides a simple way to create programs with slightly more advanced graphics and animation.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec2">How to Learn to Code</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Like anything you try for the first time, it’s always best to start with the basics, so begin with the first chapters and resist the urge to skip ahead to the later chapters. No one can play an orchestral symphony the first time they pick up an instrument. Student pilots don’t start flying a plane before they understand the basic controls. Gymnasts aren’t (usually) able to do backflips on their first try. If you jump ahead too quickly, not only will the basic ideas not stick in your head, but you’ll also find the content of the later chapters more complicated than it actually is.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">As you go through this book, try all of the examples so you can see how they work. Most chapters also include programming puzzles for you to try, which will help improve your programming skills. Remember that the better you understand the basics, the easier it will be to understand more complicated ideas later on. When you find something frustrating or too challenging, here are some things that I find helpful:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxv"/>Break a problem down into smaller pieces. Try to understand what  a small piece of code is doing or think about only a small part of a difficult idea (focus on a small piece of code rather than trying to understand the whole thing at once).</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">If that still doesn’t help, it might be best to leave it alone for a while. Sleep on it and come back to it another day. This is a good way to solve many problems, and it can be particularly helpful for computer programmers.</li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec3">Who Should Read This Book</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book is for anyone interested in computer programming, whether that’s a child or an adult coming to programming for the first time. If you want to learn how to write your own software rather than just use the programs developed by others, <em>Python for Kids</em> is a great place to start.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the following chapters, you’ll find information to help you install Python, start the Python Shell and perform basic calculations, print text on the screen and create lists, and perform simple control flow operations using <span class="literal">if</span> statements and <span class="literal">for</span> loops (and learn what <span class="literal">if</span> statements and <span class="literal">for</span> loops are!). You’ll learn how to reuse code with functions, the basics of classes and objects, and descriptions of some of the many built-in Python functions and modules.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’ll find chapters on both simple and advanced turtle graphics, as well as on using the <span class="literal">tkinter</span> module to draw on the computer screen. Programming puzzles of varying complexity are at the ends of many chapters, which will help you cement your newfound knowledge by giving you a chance to write small programs by yourself. Once you’ve built up your fundamental programming knowledge, you’ll learn how to write your own games. You’ll develop two graphical games and learn about basic collision detection, events, and different animation techniques.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Most of the examples in this book use Python’s IDLE (Integrated DeveLopment Environment) Shell. IDLE provides syntax highlighting, copy-and-paste functionality (similar to what you would use in other applications), and an editor window where you can save your code for later use. This means IDLE <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvi"/>works as both an interactive environment for experimentation and something a bit like a text editor. The examples will work just as well with the standard console and a regular text editor, but IDLE’s syntax highlighting and slightly more user-friendly environment can aid understanding, so the very first chapter shows you how to set it up.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec4">What’s in This Book</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Here’s a brief rundown of what you’ll find in each chapter.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a></strong> is an introduction to programming with instructions for installing Python for the first time.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a></strong> introduces basic calculations and variables, and <strong><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a></strong> describes some of the basic Python types, such as strings, lists, and tuples.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="ch04.xhtml#ch04">Chapter 4</a></strong> is the first taste of the <span class="literal">turtle</span> module. We’ll jump from basic programming to moving a turtle (in the shape of an arrow) around the screen.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a></strong> covers the variations of conditions and <span class="literal">if</span> statements, and <strong><a href="ch06.xhtml#ch06">Chapter 6</a></strong> moves on to <span class="literal">for</span> loops and <span class="literal">while</span> loops.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="ch07.xhtml#ch07">Chapter 7</a></strong> is where we start to use and create functions, and then in <strong><a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a></strong> we cover classes and objects. We cover enough of the basic ideas to support some of the programming techniques we’ll need in the games development chapters later on in the book. At this point, the material starts to get a little more complicated.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><strong><a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a></strong> returns to the <span class="literal">turtle</span> module as you experiments with more complicated shapes. <strong><a href="ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a></strong> moves on to using the <span class="literal">tkinter</span> module for more advanced graphics creation.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In <strong><a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapters 11</a></strong> and <strong><a href="ch12.xhtml#ch12">12</a></strong>, we create our first game, <em>Bounce!</em>, which builds on the knowledge gained from the preceding chapters, and in <strong><a href="ch13.xhtml#ch13">Chapters 13</a></strong><strong>–</strong><strong><a href="ch16.xhtml#ch16">16</a></strong>, we create another game, <em>Mr. Stick Man Races for the Exit</em>. The game development chapters are where things could start to go seriously wrong. If all else fails, download the code from the companion website (<em><a href="http://python-for-kids.com">http://python-for-kids.com</a></em>), and compare your code with these working examples.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Finally, in the <strong><a href="aft.xhtml">Afterword</a></strong>, we briefly look at how to use the Python package installer (<span class="literal">pip</span>) to install the <span class="literal">PyGame</span> module and a short <span class="literal">PyGame</span> example, before seeing some examples of other programming languages.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvii"/>In <strong><a href="app01.xhtml#app01">Appendix A</a></strong>, you’ll find a list of the Python keywords, and in <strong><a href="app02.xhtml#app02">Appendix B</a></strong>, a list of some of the useful built-in functions (you’ll learn what <em>keywords</em> and <em>functions</em> are later in the book). <strong><a href="app03.xhtml#app03">Appendix C</a></strong> provides some troubleshooting information for common problems.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec5">Python for Kids Website</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you find that you need help as you read, try the website <em><a href="http://python-for-kids.com">http://python-for-kids.com</a></em>. There, you’ll find downloads for all the examples in this book and links to further information, including where you can download the source code used in the book.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec6">Have Fun!</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Remember as you work your way through this book that programming can be fun. Don’t think of this as work. Think of programming as a way to create some fun games or applications that you can share with your friends or others.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Learning to program is a wonderful mental exercise, and the results can be very rewarding. But most of all, whatever you do, have fun!<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxviii"/></p>&#13;
