<p class="noindents">Increasingly, when you call the bank or your internet provider, you might hear something like the following on the other end of the line: “Hello, I am your digital assistant. Please ask your question.” Today, robots can talk to humans using natural language, and they’re getting smarter. Even so, very few people understand how these robots work or how they might use these technologies in their own projects.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Natural language processing (NLP)—a branch of artificial intelligence that helps machines understand and respond to human language—is the key technology that lies at the heart of any digital assistant product. This book arms you with the skills you need to start creating your own NLP applications. By the end of this book, you’ll know how to apply NLP approaches to real-world problems, such as analyzing sentences, capturing the meaning of a text, composing original texts, and even building your own chatbot.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev179"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xvi"/><strong>Using Python for Natural Language Processing</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you want to develop an NLP application, you can choose among a wide range of tools and technologies. All the examples in this book are implemented with Python code that employs the spaCy NLP library for Python. Here are some compelling reasons why you might want to choose Python and spaCy for your NLP development.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python is a high-level programming language known for the following features:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Simplicity</strong> If you’re new to programming, Python is a good language with which to start, because it’s extremely easy to learn. Due to its simplicity, Python allows you to write code that others can easily understand. For example, Python’s simplicity helps chatbot developers collaborate with linguists who don’t have much programming experience.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Prevalence</strong> Python is one of the most popular languages. The vast majority of the widely used APIs have Python wrappers that you can easily install using the <code>pip</code> installation tool. The ability to install Python wrappers via the <code>pip</code> simplifies the process of obtaining third-party tools you might want to use in your NLP applications.</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><strong>Significant presence in the AI ecosystem</strong> There are a lot of Python libraries available in the AI ecosystem. This availability simplifies the development of your NLP applications, allowing you to choose among a range of libraries to best solve a particular task.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev180"><strong>The spaCy Library</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book uses spaCy, a popular Python library that contains the linguistic data and algorithms you’ll need to process natural language texts. As you’ll learn in this book, spaCy is easy to use because it provides container objects that represent elements of natural language texts, such as sentences and words. These objects, in turn, have attributes that represent linguistic features, like parts of speech. At the time of this writing, spaCy offered pretrained models for English, German, Greek, Spanish, French, Italian, Lithuanian, Norwegian Bokmål, Dutch, Portuguese, and multiple languages combined. In addition, spaCy offers built-in visualizers that you can invoke programmatically to generate a graphic of the syntactic structure of a sentence or named entities in a document.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The spaCy library also natively supports advanced NLP features that other popular NLP libraries for Python don’t. For example, spaCy natively supports word vectors (discussed in detail in <a href="../Text/ch05.xhtml#ch05">Chapter 5</a>), unlike the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). When using the latter, you would need to use a third-party tool like Gensim, a Python implementation of the word2vec algorithm.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With spaCy, you can customize existing models or individual model components, and you can train your own models from scratch to meet your <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xvii"/>application’s requirements (you’ll learn how to do this in <a href="../Text/ch10.xhtml#ch10">Chapter 10</a>). You can also connect the statistical models trained by other popular <em>machine learning (ML)</em> libraries, such as TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, and PyTorch. In addition, spaCy can operate seamlessly with other libraries in Python’s AI ecosystem, allowing you to, for example, take advantage of computer vision in your chatbot application, as you’ll do in <a href="../Text/ch12.xhtml#ch12">Chapter 12</a>.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev181"><strong>Who Should Read This Book?</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">This book is for those interested in learning how to use NLP in practice. In particular, it might be interesting to people who want to develop chatbots for businesses or just for fun. Regardless of your background or experience with NLP or programming, you’ll be able to follow the code examples provided in this book because they all include detailed explanations of the process involved.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Some working knowledge of Python will be helpful, because the book doesn’t cover the basics of Python syntax. Also, the examples assume a school-level understanding of English grammar and syntax. The Appendix is a reference for some of the less well-known linguistic concepts. If you have a good understanding of NLP concepts and some basic programming, the examples will be even easier to follow.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="lev182"><strong>What’s in the Book?</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Natural Language Processing with Python and spaCy</em> begins with a brief introduction to the basic elements and methods of the NLP technology used to process and analyze natural language data. Then it proceeds with increasingly complicated techniques that you can use to deal with even the sophisticated challenges that natural language can pose for computer processing and analysis. The “Try This” sections in each chapter will help you reinforce the material you just learned.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here’s what you’ll find in each chapter:</p>&#13;
<p class="noindentt"><strong><a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>: <a href="../Text/ch01.xhtml#ch01">How Natural Language Processing Works</a></strong> Provides a brief introduction to the basic elements of NLP technology.
