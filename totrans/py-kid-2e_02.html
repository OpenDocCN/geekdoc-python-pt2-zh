<p class="indent">A computer program is a set of instructions that causes a computer to perform some kind of action. It isn’t the physical parts of a computer—like the wires, microchips, cards, hard drive, and such—but the hidden stuff running on that hardware. A computer program, which I’ll usually refer to as just a <em>program</em>, is the set of commands that tells that hardware what to do. <em>Software</em> is a collection of computer programs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Without computer programs, almost every device you use daily would either stop working or be much less useful than it is now. Computer <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_4"/>programs, in one form or another, control not only your personal computer but also video game systems, mobile phones, and the GPS units in cars. Software also controls items like LCD TVs and their remote controllers, as well as some of the newest radios, DVD players, ovens, and some fridges. Even car engines, traffic lights, street lamps, train signals, electronic billboards, and elevators are controlled by programs.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Programs are a bit like thoughts. If you didn’t have thoughts, you would probably just sit on the floor, staring vacantly at a wall. Your thought “get up off the floor” is an instruction, or <em>command</em>, that tells your body to stand up. In the same way, computer programs use commands to tell computers what to do.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you know how to write computer programs, you can do all sorts of useful things. Sure, you may not be able to write programs to control cars, traffic lights, or your fridge (well, at least not at first), but you could create web pages, write your own games, or even make a program to help with homework.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec1">A Few Words About Language</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Like humans, computers use multiple languages to communicate—these are called programming languages. A <em>programming language</em> is simply a way to talk to a computer by using instructions that both humans and computers can understand.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">There are programming languages named after people (like Ada and Pascal), those named using simple acronyms (like BASIC and FORTRAN), and even a few named after TV shows, like Python. Yes, the Python programming language was named after the <em>Monty Python’s Flying Circus</em> TV show, not after the snake.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep">Monty Python’s Flying Circus <em>was an alternative British comedy show first broadcast in the 1970s, and it remains hugely popular today among a certain audience. The show had sketches like “The Ministry of Silly Walks,” “The Fish-Slapping Dance,” and “The Cheese Shop” (which didn’t sell any cheese).</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Python programming language has many features that make it extremely useful for beginners. Most importantly, you can use Python to write simple, efficient programs quite quickly. Python doesn’t use as many complicated symbols as other programming languages, which makes it easier to read <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_5"/>and a lot friendlier for beginners. (That isn’t to say Python doesn’t use symbols—they’re just not used quite as heavily as in many other languages.)</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec2">Installing Python</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Installing Python is fairly straightforward. Here, we’ll go over the steps for installing it on Windows, macOS, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi. When installing Python, you’ll also install the IDLE program, which is the <strong>I</strong>ntegrated <strong>D</strong>eve<strong>L</strong>opment <strong>E</strong>nvironment that lets you write programs for Python. If Python has already been installed on your computer, jump ahead to “Once You’ve Installed Python” on <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev1sec3">page 10</a>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec1">Installing Python on Windows</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">To install Python for Microsoft Windows 11, download a version of Python for Windows that is 3.10 or higher at <em><a href="http://www.python.org/downloads/">http://www.python.org/downloads/</a></em>. The exact version of Python that you download is not important, as long as it’s at least version 3.10. However, if you are using an older version of Windows (like Windows 7), the latest version of Python will not work—in this case, you’ll need to install Python 3.8. See the Windows download page (<em><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/">https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/</a></em>) regarding which versions of Python will work with your version of Windows.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig01"><img src="Images/01fig01.jpg" alt="Image" width="601" height="261"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-1: The Python download for Windows</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If your browser asks whether to save or open your file, choose to save it. Once you’ve downloaded the Python for Windows installation file, you should be prompted to run it. If not, open your <em>Downloads</em> folder and double-click the file. Now, follow <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"/>the installation instructions on screen to install Python in the default location, as follows:</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Click <strong>Install Now</strong>.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">When asked whether to allow the app to make changes to your device, choose <strong>Yes</strong>.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Click <strong>Close</strong> once installation finishes, and you should see a number of Python 3.1<em>x</em> icons in your Windows Start menu:</li></ol>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig02"><img src="Images/01fig02.jpg" alt="Image" width="602" height="350"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-2: Your Start menu may look different depending on the version of Python you use.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now skip to “Once You’ve Installed Python” on <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev1sec3">page 10</a> to get started with Python.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec2">Installing Python on macOS</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you’re using a Mac, you should find a version of Python pre-installed, but it might be an older version of the language. To be sure you’re running a recent enough version, click the spotlight icon (the magnifying glass in the top-right corner), and type <strong>terminal</strong> in the dialog that appears. When the terminal opens, type <strong><span class="literal">python3 --version</span></strong> (that’s two hyphens, followed by the word <em>version</em>) and hit ENTER.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you see either <span class="literal">command not found</span> or a version that is less than 3.10, point your browser to the following URL to download the latest installer for macOS: <em><a href="http://www.python.org/downloads/">http://www.python.org/downloads/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig03"><img src="Images/01fig03.jpg" alt="Image" width="601" height="280"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-3: Python download for macOS</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"/>Once downloaded, double-click the file (it should be called something like <em>python-3.10.0-macosx11.pkg</em>). Agree to the license and follow the onscreen instructions to install the software. You should be prompted for the administrator password for your Mac before Python installs. If you don’t have the password, ask your parents or whoever is the owner of your machine.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig04"><img src="Images/01fig04.jpg" alt="Image" width="526" height="278"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-4: Python in Mac Finder</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Skip to “Once You’ve Installed Python” on <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev1sec3">page 10</a> to get started with Python.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec3">Installing Python on Ubuntu</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Python comes pre-installed on Ubuntu Linux, but it may not be the latest version. Follow these instructions to get the latest version of Python (note that you may need to change the version number in the command that follows to reflect the latest version).</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"/>Click the Show Applications icon (usually nine dots in the bottom-left corner of the screen).</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Enter <strong>terminal</strong> in the input box (or click <strong>Terminal</strong> if it’s already displayed).</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">When the terminal window appears, enter:&#13;
<pre class="pre1">sudo apt update&#13;
sudo apt install python<span class="codeitalic1">3.10</span> idle-python<span class="codeitalic1">3.10</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You might be prompted to enter the administrator password for your  computer after entering the first command (if you don’t have the  administrator password, you may need to ask a parent or teacher to enter  it).</p></li>&#13;
</ol>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig05"><img src="Images/01fig05.jpg" alt="Image" width="601" height="395"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-5: Python installation in the Terminal on Ubuntu; your output may look slightly different depending on which version you download</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Skip to “Once You’ve Installed Python” on <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01lev1sec3">page 10</a> to get started with Python.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec4">Installing Python on Raspberry Pi (Raspberry Pi OS or Raspbian)</h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Python 3 comes pre-installed with Raspberry Pi’s operating system, but at the time of this writing, it’s version 3.7. Installing a later version is slightly more complicated than with the other operating systems—you need to download and build the Python <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"/>installation yourself. This isn’t as scary as it sounds. Simply enter the following commands one by one and wait for each to complete (note that you may need to change the version numbers if you are downloading a version of Python later than 3.10):</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1">sudo apt update&#13;
sudo apt install libffi-dev libssl-dev tk tk-dev&#13;
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/<span class="codeitalic1">3.10.0</span>/Python-<span class="codeitalic1">3.10.0</span>.tar.xz&#13;
tar -xvf Python<span class="codeitalic1">3.10.0</span>.tar.xz&#13;
cd Python-<span class="codeitalic1">3.10.0</span>&#13;
./configure --prefix=/usr/local/opt/python-<span class="codeitalic1">3.10.0</span>&#13;
make -j 4&#13;
sudo make altinstall</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The second-to-last step will take the longest to finish because it’s building all the code that goes into the Python application.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig06"><img src="Images/01fig06.jpg" alt="Image" width="601" height="416"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-6: Python installation in the Terminal on Raspberry Pi; your output may look slightly different depending on which version of Python you download.</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Once Python is installed, you need to add a program called IDLE into the menu (this makes life easier later):</p>&#13;
<ol>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Click the raspberry icon in the top left of the screen, then click <strong>Preferences</strong> and <strong>Main Menu Editor</strong>.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/>In the window that appears, click <strong>Programming</strong>, and then click the <strong>New Item</strong> button.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">In the Launcher Properties dialog shown in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01fig07">Figure 1-7</a>, enter the name as <strong>idle3.10</strong>, and enter this as the command, changing the version number as needed:&#13;
<pre class="pre1">/usr/local/opt/python-3.10.0/bin/idle3.10</pre></li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">Click <strong>OK</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong> again in the main editor window to finish. Then you can move on to the next section.</li></ol>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig07"><img src="Images/01fig07.jpg" alt="Image" width="376" height="180"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-7: Launcher set up in the Raspberry Pi</em></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec3">Once You’ve Installed Python</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">With Python installed, let’s write our first program in IDLE (also called the <em>Shell</em>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re using Windows, enter <strong>idle</strong> in the Windows search box (bottom left of the screen), and select <strong>IDLE (Python 3.1<em>x</em> 64-bit)</strong> when it appears in the Best Match menu.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re using a Mac, navigate to <strong>Go</strong>  ▸ <strong>Applications</strong> and open the Python 3.1<em>x</em> folder to find IDLE.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re using Ubuntu, when you click <strong>Show Applications</strong> and then click the <strong>All</strong> tab at the bottom, you should see an entry titled <em>IDLE (using</em> <em>Python-3.1</em>x<em>)</em>—you can also enter IDLE in the search box if you can’t see it.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re using a Raspberry Pi, click the raspberry icon at the top left of the screen, click <strong>Programming</strong>, and then select <strong>idle3.1<em>x</em></strong> from the list displayed.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you open IDLE, you should see a window like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig08"><img src="Images/01fig08.jpg" alt="Image" width="676" height="236"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-8: IDLE Shell in Windows</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"/>This is the <em>Python Shell</em>, which is part of Python’s integrated development environment. The three greater-than signs (<span class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>) are called the <em>prompt</em>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s enter some commands at the prompt, beginning with the following:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>("Hello World")</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Make sure to include the double quotes (<span class="literal">“ ”</span>). Press ENTER on your keyboard when you’re finished typing the line. If you’ve entered the command correctly, you should see something like this:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>("Hello World")&#13;
<span class="blue">Hello World</span>&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The prompt should reappear to let you know that the Python Shell is ready to accept more commands.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Congratulations! You’ve just created your first Python program. The word <span class="literal">print</span> is a type of Python command called a <em>function</em>, and it prints out whatever is inside the parentheses to the screen. In essence, you have given the computer an instruction to display the words “Hello World”—an instruction both you and the computer can understand.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="Images/f0011-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="195" height="254"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"/>Saving Your Python Programs</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Python programs wouldn’t be very useful if you needed to rewrite them every time you wanted to use them, never mind print them out so you could reference them. Sure, it might be fine to rewrite short programs, but a large program, like a word processor, could contain millions of lines of code. Print that all out, and you could have well over 100,000 pages. Just imagine trying to carry that huge stack of paper home. Better hope that you won’t meet up with a big gust of wind.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Luckily, we can save our programs for future use. To create and save a new program, open IDLE and choose <strong>File</strong>  ▸ <strong>New</strong> <strong>Window</strong>. An empty window will appear, with *Untitled* in the menu bar. Enter the following code into the new shell window:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>("Hello World")</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now, choose <strong>File</strong>  ▸ <strong>Save</strong>. When prompted for a filename, enter <em>hello.py</em>, and save the file to your desktop. Then choose <strong>Run</strong>  ▸ <strong>Run Module</strong>.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">With any luck, your saved program should run, like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig09"><img src="Images/01fig09.jpg" alt="Image" width="675" height="213"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-9: Hello World in IDLE</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now, if you close the shell window but leave the <em>hello.py</em> window open, and then choose <strong>Run</strong>  ▸ <strong>Run Module</strong>, the Python Shell should reappear, and your program should run again (to reopen the Python Shell without running the program, choose <strong>Run</strong>  ▸ <strong>Python Shell</strong>).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">After running the code, you’ll find a new icon on your desktop labeled <em>hello.py</em>. If you double-click the icon, a black window will appear briefly and then vanish. What happened?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’re seeing the Python command line console (similar to the shell) start up, print <span class="literal">Hello World</span>, and then exit. Here’s what <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"/>would appear if you had superhero-like speed vision and could see the window before it closed:</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch01fig10"><img src="Images/01fig10.jpg" alt="Image" width="528" height="274"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 1-10: Hello World in the console</em></p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Depending on your operating system, this might not work—or it may run using a different version of Python than the one we’ve installed.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In addition to the menus, you can use keyboard shortcuts to create a new shell window, save a file, and run a program:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="noindent">On Windows, Ubuntu, and Raspberry Pi, press CTRL-N to create a new shell window, CTRL-S to save your file after you’ve finished editing, and F5 to run your program.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">On macOS, press COMMAND-N to create a new shell window, COMMAND-S to save your file, and hold down the function (Fn) key and press F5 to run your program.</li></ul>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec5">What You Learned</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We began simply in this chapter with a Hello World application—the program nearly everyone starts with when they learn computer programming. In the next chapter, we’ll do some more useful things with the Python Shell.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"/></p>&#13;
