    that “the sexy job in the next 10 years will be statisticians.” In the years since
    he made that claim, two things have happened: we’ve started calling statisticians
    *data scientists*, and the profession has seen enormous growth, both in demand
    for skilled practitioners and in salaries.'

    of the aim of this book is to help solve that problem by introducing you to all
    of the main data science techniques being used at today’s top firms. Explanations
    come with working, thoroughly explained code for every example, and we also provide
    ideas about how various data science methods are applied and how to find creative
    solutions to challenges. The book is meant to give anyone who reads it the skills
    to become a data scientist and take on the toughest and most exciting challenges
    being faced by businesses today.

    combining elements of statistics, software development, math, economics, and computer
    science. It allows you to analyze data, detect differences between groups, investigate
    causes of mysterious phenomena, classify species, and perform experiments—in other
    words, to do science. Anyone who gets excited about discovering the truth about
    something hard to understand, or who wants to understand the world better, should
    feel excited about this aspect of data science.

    solve business problems and make your business more successful. It can make you
    more of a scientist, better able to observe and clearly understand the world around
    you. It can sharpen your analytical abilities and your coding skills. What’s more,
    it can be fun. Becoming a data scientist means joining a field that’s constantly
    growing and expanding, and this will mean that you need to expand your own knowledge
    and skills every day. If you feel up to the challenge of learning a wide range
    of difficult new skills that will help you work better, think better, and get
    a “sexy” job, read on.

    the *Python standard library*, or in more colloquial terms, *base Python*. Base
    Python enables you to run simple Python code and contains standard capabilities
    that are built into the Python language. Base Python is powerful, and you can
    do many remarkable things with it. But it can’t do everything, and this is why
    kind, talented people in the Python community create Python packages.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that provide extra capabilities not present in base Python. For example, you may
    find that you have some data stored in Microsoft Excel format, and you may want
    to write Python code that will read this Excel data. There’s no straightforward
    way to do this in base Python, but a package called *pandas* enables you to read
    Excel files in Python quite easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    it. A few packages are installed by default when you install base Python, but
    most packages need to be installed manually. To install any Python package manually,
    you’ll need Python’s standard package installation tool, pip.
