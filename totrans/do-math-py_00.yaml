- en: This book’s goal is to bring together three topics near to my heart—programming,
    math, and science. What does that mean exactly? Within these pages, we’ll programmatically
    explore high school–level topics, like manipulating units of measurement; examining
    projectile motion; calculating mean, median, and mode; determining linear correlation;
    solving algebraic equations; describing the motion of a simple pendulum; simulating
    dice games; creating geometric shapes; and finding the limits, derivatives, and
    integrals of functions. These are familiar topics for many, but instead of using
    pen and paper, we’ll use our computer to explore them.

- en: We’ll write programs that will take numbers and formulas as input, do the tedious
    calculations needed, and then spit out the solution or draw a graph. Some of these
    programs are powerful calculators for solving math problems. They find the solutions
    to equations, calculate the correlation between sets of data, and determine the
    maximum value of a function, among other tasks. In other programs, we’ll simulate
    real-life events, such as projectile motion, a coin toss, or a die roll. Using
    programs to simulate such events gives us an easy way to analyze and learn more
    about them.

    programs. For example, drawing fractals by hand is tedious at best and close to
    impossible at worst. With a program, all we need to do is run a for loop with
    the relevant operation in the body of the loop.

    programming and math more exciting, fun, and rewarding.

- en: If you yourself are learning programming, you’ll appreciate how this book demonstrates
    ways to solve problems with computers. Likewise, if you teach such learners, I
    hope you find this book useful to demonstrate the application of programming skills
    beyond the sometimes abstract world of computer science.

    using Python 3—specifically, what a function is, function arguments, the concept
    of a Python class and class objects, and loops. [Appendix B](app02.html#app02)
    covers some of the other Python topics that are used by the programs, but this
    book doesn’t assume knowledge of these additional topics. If you find yourself
    needing more background, I recommend reading *Python for Kids* by Jason Briggs
    (No Starch Press, 2013).

- en: This book consists of seven chapters and two appendices. Each chapter ends with
    challenges for the reader. I recommend giving these a try, as there’s much to
    learn from trying to write your own original programs. Some of these challenges
    will ask you to explore new topics, which is a great way to enhance your learning.
