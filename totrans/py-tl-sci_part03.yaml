- en: The Python scientific ecosystem is *robust*, which means it attempts to satisfy
    the same needs in multiple ways. As discussed in this book’s introduction, this
    can lead to a bewildering maze of packages and tools for users to negotiate. It’s
    easy to become overwhelmed by the literally thousands of Python packages available
    to you through conda and conda-forge.
  prefs: []

- en: Fortunately, only a few packages are considered essential to scientific work.
    These libraries form the basic Python ecosystem for scientific research and are
    shown, with a few overlapping, ancillary, and competing libraries, in [Figure
    III-1](part03.xhtml#ch0iiifig1) (PyCharm and Spyder, for example, are similar
    programming tools available through Anaconda).

- en: At the core of this ecosystem is Python. In [Figure III-1](part03.xhtml#ch0iiifig1),
    at the outer edge, Anaconda coils around Python and the other libraries and tools
    to help you use them efficiently. Between Python and Anaconda are several rings,
    or layers, meant to convey that some libraries are built atop others.
  prefs: []

- en: The outer two rings hold tools that help you to write code, run code, and review
    the output. These include the (by-now-familiar) *Jupyter Qt console*, *Jupyter
    Notebook*, *Spyder*, and *JupyterLab*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The innermost three rings hold some of the many scientific and plotting libraries
    available through Anaconda. We’ll take a quick look at many of these in [Part
    III](part03.xhtml#part03) so that you can become conversant on what they do, why
    you need them, and how you might choose among overlapping or competing versions.
    In [Part IV](part04.xhtml#part04), we’ll take a deeper—though not comprehensive—dive
    into some of the more important ones.
