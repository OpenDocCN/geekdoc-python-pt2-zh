- en: We live in a world of information technology (IT), where computer systems collect
    enormous quantities of data, process it, and extract useful information from it.
    This data-driven reality affects not only the way modern businesses operate but
    our daily lives too. Without the numerous devices and systems that employ data-focused
    technologies, it would be hard for many of us to maintain contact with society.
    Mobile maps and navigation, online shopping, and smart home devices are some common
    examples of data-focused technology for everyday life.

- en: In the business world, companies often use IT systems to make decisions by extracting
    actionable information from large volumes of data. The data may arrive from various
    sources, in different formats, and may require transformation before it’s ready
    for analysis. For example, many companies that do business online use data analytics
    to drive customer acquisition and retention, collecting and measuring everything
    they can to model and understand their users’ behavior. They often combine and
    analyze both quantitative and qualitative user data from many different sources,
    such as user profiles, social media, and company websites. And in many cases,
    they accomplish all these tasks using the Python programming language.

    the taint of academic jargon or excessive complexity. You’ll learn to use Python
    for data-oriented applications, writing code to power a ride-sharing service,
    generate product recommendations, predict stock market trends, and more. Through
    real-world examples such as these, you’ll gain practical, hands-on experience
    with the key Python data science libraries.

- en: The easy-on-the-brain Python programming language is an ideal choice for accessing,
    manipulating, and gaining insight from data of any kind. It has both a rich set
    of built-in data structures for basic operations and a robust ecosystem of open
    source libraries for data analysis and manipulation of any level of complexity.
    We’ll explore many such libraries in this book, including NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn,
    Matplotlib, and more.

    effort, expressing most concepts in just a few lines of code. In fact, Python’s
    agile syntax allows you to implement several data operations with a single line
    of code. For example, you can write a one-liner that filters, transforms, and
    aggregates data all at once.

    When you work with Python, you can seamlessly integrate data science with other
    tasks to create fully functional, well-rounded applications. For example, you
    could build a bot application that makes stock market predictions in response
    to natural language requests from users. To create such an application, you’d
    need a bot API, a machine learning model to make predictions, and a natural language
    processing (NLP) tool to interact with users. There are powerful Python libraries
    for all of these.

- en: This book is for developers looking to gain a better understanding of Python’s
    data processing and analysis capabilities. Perhaps you work for a company that
    wants to use data to improve business processes, make better decisions, and target
    more customers. Or maybe you want to develop your own data-driven applications,
    or simply expand your knowledge of Python into the realm of data science.

- en: The book assumes you have some basic experience with Python and that you’re
    comfortable following instructions to perform tasks such as installing a database
    or obtaining an API key. However, the book covers Python data science concepts
    from the bottom up, through hands-on examples that are all thoroughly explained.
    You’ll learn by doing, with no prior data experience necessary.

- en: The book begins with a conceptual introduction to data processing and analysis,
    explaining a typical data processing pipeline. Then we’ll cover Python’s built-in
    data structures and some of the third-party Python libraries that are widely used
    for data science applications. Next, we’ll explore increasingly sophisticated
    techniques for obtaining, combining, aggregating, grouping, analyzing, and visualizing
    datasets of different sizes and data types. As the book goes on, we’ll apply Python
    data science techniques to real use cases from the world of business management,
    marketing, and finance. Along the way, each chapter contains “Exercise” sections
    so you can practice and reinforce what you’ve just learned.
