<p class="noindents">Before you jump into whatever is next, I’d like to take a minute to congratulate you on what you’ve accomplished to this point. It’s possible that you hadn’t done any programming before picking up this book. Or maybe you had done a little programming and wanted to improve your problem-solving ability. Regardless, if you’ve made it through the book and spent the necessary time grinding through the exercises, you now know how to solve problems using a computer. You learned how to understand a problem description, design a solution, and write that solution in code. You learned about <span class="literal">if</span> statements, loops, lists, functions, files, sets, dictionaries, complete-search algorithms, and big O analysis. These are the core tools of programming, and the tools that you’ll turn to again and again. You can also now call yourself a Python programmer!</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_296"/>Perhaps your next step is to learn more about Python. If that’s the case, see the notes at the end of <a href="ch08.xhtml#ch08">Chapter 8</a>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Perhaps your next step is to learn another programming language. One of my personal favorites is C. Compared to Python, it brings you much closer to what’s actually going on inside your computer when programs are running. If you’d like to learn C, there’s no better book than <em>C Programming: A Modern Approach</em>, 2nd edition, by K. N. King (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2008). I think you’re well positioned to read that book at this point. You might also consider learning a language such as C++, Java, Go, or Rust, depending on the types of programs you want to write (or simply because of what you’ve heard about these languages).</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Perhaps your next step is to learn more about designing algorithms. If that’s the case, see the notes at the end of <a href="ch09.xhtml#ch09">Chapter 9</a>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Perhaps your next step is to take a break from this. To do something else. To solve other kinds of problems that may or may not have anything to do with computing.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Happy problem solving!</p>&#13;&#13;
