    and worth a review since they provide the foundations to build more powerful and

- en: The best way to understand the impact an array’s structure has on how it can
    be used is to examine it in the context of an actual algorithm. *Insertion sort*
    is an algorithm to sort the values in an array. It works on any type of value
    that can be ordered. We could sort integers, strings, or even the coffees in our
    pantry by expiration date.

- en: Insertion sort works by sorting a subset of the array and expanding this sorted
    range until the entire array is in order. The algorithm iterates through each
    element in the unsorted array and moves it down into the correct location of the
    sorted section. At the start of iteration `i`, the items in bins 0 through `i`
    − 1 are all in sorted order. The algorithm then takes the item at index `i`, finds
    the correct location in the sorted prefix, and inserts it, shifting the necessary
    items down to make room. The sorted prefix has now grown by one—bins 0 through
    `i` are in sorted order. We can start at `i` = 1 by declaring the first element
    to be our initial sorted prefix.

    would be tragic to leave a bag of premium coffee languishing at the back of the
    pantry until it was stale. We need to move the earliest best-by dates to the left
    side of the shelf where they can be readily accessible.

- en: We begin our coffee insertion sort by proclaiming a single bag at the front
    to be *sorted* and using this range as our sorted prefix. We then look at the
    second bag on the shelf and compare dates to determine whether it should go before
    the first one. After we swap the order, or determine that a swap isn’t necessary,
    we can confidently proclaim that the first two elements are sorted. We have a
    subset that’s fully sorted. We then progress to the third bag and determine where
    it should sit relative to the first two, perhaps making a few swaps in the process.
    This process continues down the shelf until we’ve achieved perfect coffee organization.

- en: The outer loop with iterator `i` starts at the first unsorted element, `i =
    1` and progresses through each value in the unsorted range ❶. The inner loop with
    iterator `j` shifts the current value down into the sorted prefix ❷. At each step,
    we check the position within the sorted prefix by comparing the `current` value
    to the preceding location in the prefix, index `j`. If the element at `j` is larger,
    the two values are in the wrong order and must be swapped. Since we are storing
    the current value in a separate variable `current`, we copy the data from the
    preceding bin directly. There is no need to do a full swap. The inner loop continues
    until it shifts the current value to the front of the array or it finds a preceding
    value that is smaller, which indicates the current value is in the correct location
    of the sorted prefix. We only need to write the current value at the end of the
    loop when it is in the correct location. The outer loop then proceeds to the next
    unsorted value.

- en: Insertion sort isn’t particularly efficient. When inserting elements into the
    array, we could end up shifting around significant portions of the array. In the
    worst case, the cost of the algorithm scales proportionally with the square of
    the number of items—for every item in the list, we shift all the items in front
    of it. If we double the size of the array, we increase the worst-case cost by
    a factor of four. While this may not be a huge cost in our coffee pantry, where
    we are likely to keep only a small number of coffees that we can consume before
    they go stale, the quadratic cost of the algorithm skyrockets in many applications.

- en: In some programming languages, strings are directly implemented as simple arrays
    of characters. In others, strings may be objects, and the string class serves
    as a wrapper around an array or other data structure holding the characters. The
    wrapper class for a string provides additional functionality, such as the ability
    to dynamically resize the string or search for a substring. In either case, it
    is useful to think about how the general array-like structure impacts operations
    on the string. When we display a string on the computer screen, we are effectively
    iterating through each of its characters and displaying them one at a time.

    For comparison, imagine the tedium of scanning through two editions of the same
    book, letter by letter, looking for each difference in the arrangement of text
