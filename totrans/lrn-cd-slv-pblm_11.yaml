    you on what you’ve accomplished to this point. It’s possible that you hadn’t done
    any programming before picking up this book. Or maybe you had done a little programming
    and wanted to improve your problem-solving ability. Regardless, if you’ve made
    it through the book and spent the necessary time grinding through the exercises,
    you now know how to solve problems using a computer. You learned how to understand
    a problem description, design a solution, and write that solution in code. You
    learned about `if` statements, loops, lists, functions, files, sets, dictionaries,
    complete-search algorithms, and big O analysis. These are the core tools of programming,
    and the tools that you’ll turn to again and again. You can also now call yourself
    a Python programmer!

    personal favorites is C. Compared to Python, it brings you much closer to what’s
    actually going on inside your computer when programs are running. If you’d like
    to learn C, there’s no better book than *C Programming: A Modern Approach*, 2nd
    edition, by K. N. King (W. W. Norton & Company, 2008). I think you’re well positioned
    to read that book at this point. You might also consider learning a language such
    as C++, Java, Go, or Rust, depending on the types of programs you want to write
    (or simply because of what you’ve heard about these languages).'

    solve other kinds of problems that may or may not have anything to do with computing.
