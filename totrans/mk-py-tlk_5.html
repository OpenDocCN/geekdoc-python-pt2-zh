<p class="ChapterIntro">In this appendix, I’ll discuss the various modules for playing audio files in Python. While there is no feasible way to account for all the differences in hardware and operating system combinations, I have tested the instructions in this book on a variety of hardware and software platforms. In doing so, I encountered various problems, and I want to help you avoid those problems. </p>
<p>There are two types of modules when it comes to playing audio files. The first type (which we can call <em>blocking</em>) will take control of the script and won’t let your execution move to the next line of code until the audio file is finished playing. We’ll discuss two modules in this category: <em>playsound</em> and <em>pydub</em>. You need to make only one of them work for this book. The second type won’t take control of the script; it simply moves on to the next line of code as soon as the audio file starts playing (we can refer to this as <em>non-blocking</em>). We’ll look at two modules in this category: <em>vlc</em> and <em>pygame</em>. Similarly, you need to make only one of them work for this book.</p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="348" id="Page_348"/>Both module types are used in this book. The blocking type is the most common, and we use it to play most audio files in our scripts. The non-blocking type is useful when the audio file is long and you want the option of pausing or stopping while it’s playing. We use this in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 6">Chapter 6</span> in the script <em>news_brief_hs.py</em>  and in the music-playing functionality in our ultimate VPA script, <em>vpa_final.py</em>, in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 17">Chapter 17</span> . </p>
<p>Next, we’ll discuss how to install these four modules in different operating systems. </p>
<h2 id="h1-501560b01-0001">	Install the playsound Module</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The <em>playsound</em> module is easy to use since the required lines of code are minimal. However, installing in Mac or Linux may be difficult, even though I have managed to install it in all three operating systems.</p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0001">Windows</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">To install <em>playsound</em> in Windows, execute the following command in an Anaconda prompt with your <em>chatting</em> virtual environment activated:</p>
<pre><code><b>pip install playsound</b></code></pre>
<p>Follow the instructions. </p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0002">Mac</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">To install <em>playsound</em> in Mac, execute the following two commands in a terminal with your <em>chatting</em> virtual environment activated:</p>
<pre><code><b>pip install playsound</b>
<b>conda install -c conda-forge pygobject</b></code></pre>
<p>Follow the instructions. </p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0003">Linux</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">To install <em>playsound</em> in Linux, execute the following three commands in a terminal with your <em>chatting</em> virtual environment activated:</p>
<pre><code><b>pip install playsound</b>
<b>conda install –c conda-forge pygobject</b>
<b>conda install gstreamer</b></code></pre>
<p>Follow the instructions. </p>
<h2 id="h1-501560b01-0002">	Install the pydub Module</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">The <em>pydub</em> module is easy to install in Mac or Linux. However, installing in Windows may be difficult, even though I have managed to install it in all <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="349" id="Page_349"/>three operating systems. To install <em>pydub</em>, execute the following commands in your Anaconda prompt (Windows) or a terminal (Mac and Linux) with your <em>chatting</em> virtual environment activated:</p>
<pre><code><b>conda install –c conda-forge pydub</b>
<b>conda install –c conda-forge ffmpeg</b></code></pre>
<h2 id="h1-501560b01-0003">	Install the pygame Module</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">Since software is constantly being updated, the installation instructions are likely to change. I suggest you refer to the Pygame official website, <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted/" class="LinkURL">https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted/</a>, for instructions if you get stuck. </p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0004">Windows</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Execute this command in your Anaconda prompt with your <em>chatting</em> virtual environment activated:</p>
<pre><code><b>pip install pygame</b></code></pre>
<p>Follow the instructions. </p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0005">Mac</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Recent versions of macOS require the installation of Pygame 2. To install, execute this command in a terminal with your <em>chatting</em> virtual environment activated:</p>
<pre><code><b>pip install pygame==2.0.0</b></code></pre>
<p>Then follow the instructions. </p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0006">Linux</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">In Linux, execute the following three commands in a terminal with your <em>chatting</em> virtual environment activated:</p>
<pre><code><b>sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev</b>
<b>sudo pip3 install pygame</b>
<b>pip install pygame</b></code></pre>
<h2 id="h1-501560b01-0004">	Install the vlc Module</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">For the <em>vlc</em> module, you need to have VLC Media Player installed on your computer no matter which operating system you are using. Go to the VLC website at <a href="https://www.videolan.org/index.html" class="LinkURL">https://www.videolan.org/index.html</a> to download the software and install it. </p>
<p>In Linux, you can install the app by running this command in a terminal: </p>
<pre><code><b>sudo apt-get install vlc</b></code></pre>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="350" id="Page_350"/>With your <em>chatting</em> virtual environment activated in an Anaconda prompt (Windows) or a terminal (Mac or Linux), install the Python <em>vlc</em> module by running the following command:</p>
<pre><code><b>pip install python-vlc </b></code></pre>
<h2 id="h1-501560b01-0005">	Sample Scripts to Test the Four Modules</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">In this section, we provide a sample script for each of the four modules to test that the modules are running successfully. Again, you need to install only one out of <em>playsound</em> and <em>pydub</em> and one out of <em>vlc</em> and <em>pygame</em> for this book. </p>
<p>Go to the book’s resources and download the file <em>hello.mp3</em> for testing purposes. Be sure to place the file in the same folder as the testing scripts created next. </p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0007">The playsound Module</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Enter the following lines of code in your Spyder editor. Save the script as <em>test_playsound.py</em> and run it. Alternatively, you can download it from the book’s resources.</p>
<pre><code><b>from playsound import playsound</b>
<b>playsound("hello.mp3")</b></code></pre>
<p>If successful, you should hear a human voice saying, “Hello, how are you?”</p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0008">The pydub Module</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Enter the following lines of code in your Spyder editor. Save the script as <em>test_pydub.py</em> and run it. Alternatively, you can download it from the book’s resources.</p>
<pre><code><b>from pydub import AudioSegment</b>
<b>from pydub.playback import play</b>
<b>play(AudioSegment.from_mp3("hello.mp3")</b></code></pre>
<p>If successful, you should hear a human voice saying, “Hello, how are you?”</p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0009">The pygame Module</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Enter the following lines of code in your Spyder editor. Save the script as <em>test_pygame.py</em> and run it. Alternatively, you can download it from the book’s resources.</p>
<pre><code><b>from pygame import mixer</b>
<b>mixer.init()</b>
<b>mixer.music.load("hello.mp3")</b>
<b>mixer.music.play()</b></code></pre>
<p>If successful, you should hear a human voice saying, “Hello, how are you?”</p>
<h3 id="h2-501560b01-0010"><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="351" id="Page_351"/>The vlc Module</h3>
<p class="BodyFirst">Enter the following lines of code in your Spyder editor. Save the script as <em>test_vlc.py</em> and run it. Or you can download it from the book’s resources.</p>
<pre><code><b>from vlc import MediaPlayer</b>
<b>player=MediaPlayer("hello.mp3")</b>
<b>player.play()</b></code></pre>
<p>If successful, you should hear a human voice saying, “Hello, how are you?”</p>
