<div class="image1"><img src="../images/common01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Astronauts live by lists. The safety checklists they use help make sure all systems are working before they entrust their lives to those systems. For example, emergency checklists tell the astronauts what to do in dire situations to prevent them from panicking. Procedural checklists confirm that they’re using their equipment correctly so nothing breaks and prevents them from returning home. These lists just might save their lives one day.</p>
<p class="indent">In this chapter, you’ll learn how to manage lists in Python and how to use them for checklists, maps, and almost anything in the universe. When you build the <em>Escape</em> game, you’ll use lists to store information about the space station layout.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev32"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34"/><strong>MAKING YOUR FIRST LIST: THE TAKE-OFF CHECKLIST</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentb">Take-off is one of the most dangerous aspects of space travel. When you’re strapped to a rocket, you want to double-check everything before it launches. A simple checklist for take-off might contain the following steps:</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Put on suit</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Seal hatch</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Check cabin pressure</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Fasten seatbelt</p>
<p class="indentt">Python has the perfect way to store this information: the Python <em>list</em> is like a variable that stores multiple items. As you’ll see, you can use it for numbers and text as well as a combination of both.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s make a list in Python called <span class="literal">take_off_checklist</span> for our astronauts to use. Because we’re just practicing with a short example, we’ll enter the code in the Python shell rather than creating a program. (If you need a refresher on how to use the Python shell, see “<a href="ch01.xhtml#lev20">Introducing the Python Shell</a>” on <a href="ch01.xhtml#page_15">page 15</a>.) Enter the following in the IDLE shell, pressing <small>ENTER</small> at the end of each line to start a new line in the list:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> take_off_checklist = [<span class="green">"Put on suit"</span>,<br/>                          <span class="green">"Seal hatch"</span>,<br/>                          <span class="green">"Check cabin pressure"</span>,<br/>                          <span class="green">"Fasten seatbelt"</span>]</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">RED ALERT</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Make sure the brackets, quote marks, and commas in your code are precise. If you get any errors, enter the list code again, and double-check that the brackets, quotes, and commas are in the correct places. To avoid having to retype the code, use your mouse to highlight the text in the shell, right-click the text, select <strong>Copy</strong>, right-click again, and select <strong>Paste</strong>.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s take a closer look at how the <span class="literal">take_off_checklist</span> list is made. You mark the start of the list with an opening square bracket. Python knows the list is not finished until it detects the final closing square bracket. This means you can press <small>ENTER</small> at the end of each line to continue typing the instruction, and Python will know you’re not finished until you’ve given it the final bracket.</p>
<p class="indent">Quote marks tell Python that you’re giving it some text and where each piece of text starts and ends. Each entry needs its own opening and closing quote marks. You also need to separate the different pieces of text with commas. The last entry doesn’t need a comma after it, because there isn’t another list item following it.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev33"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35"/><strong>SEEING YOUR LIST</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">To see your checklist, you can use the <span class="literal">print()</span> function, as we did in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>. Add the name of your list to the <span class="literal">print()</span> function, like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist)<br/>[<span class="blue">'Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Fasten seatbelt'</span>]</p>
<p class="indent">You don’t need quotes around <span class="literal">take_off_checklist</span>, because it’s the name of a list, not a piece of text. If you do put quotes around it, Python will just write the text <span class="literal">take_off_checklist</span> onscreen instead of giving you back your list. Try it to see what happens.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev34"><strong>ADDING AND REMOVING ITEMS</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Even after you’ve created a list, you can add an item to it using the <span class="literal">append()</span> command. The word <em>append</em> means to add something at the end (think of an appendix, at the end of a book). You use the <span class="literal">append()</span> command like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> take_off_checklist.append(<span class="green">"Tell Mission Control checks are complete")</span></p>
<p class="indent">You enter the name of the list (without quote marks) followed by a period and the <span class="literal">append()</span> command, and then put the item to add in parentheses. The item will be added to the end of the list, as you’ll see when you print the list again:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist)<br/><span class="blue">['Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Fasten seatbelt', 'Tell<br/>Mission Control checks are complete']</span></p>
<p class="indent">You can also take items out of the list using the <span class="literal">remove()</span> command. Let’s remove the <span class="literal">Seal hatch</span> item:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> take_off_checklist.remove(<span class="green">"Seal hatch"</span>)<br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist)<br/><span class="blue">['Put on suit', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Fasten seatbelt', 'Tell Mission<br/>Control checks are complete']</span></p>
<p class="indent">Again, you enter the name of the list followed by a period and the <span class="literal">remove()</span> command, and then specify the item you want to remove inside the parentheses.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">RED ALERT</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>When you’re removing an item from a list, make sure what you type matches the item exactly, including capital letters and any punctuation. Otherwise, Python won’t recognize it and will give you an error.</em></p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev35"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36"/><strong>USING INDEX NUMBERS</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Hmm, we should probably put the <span class="literal">Seal hatch</span> check back into the list before anyone at Mission Control notices. You can insert an item in a specific position in the list by using that item’s index number. The <em>index</em> is the position of the item in the list. Python starts counting at 0, not 1, so the first item in the list always has an index of 0, the second item has an index of 1, and so on.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev36"><strong>INSERTING AN ITEM</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Using the position index, we’ll put <span class="literal">Seal hatch</span> back where it belongs:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> take_off_checklist.insert(1, <span class="green">"Seal hatch"</span>)<br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist)<br/>[<span class="blue">'Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Fasten seatbelt', 'Tell<br/>Mission Control checks are complete'</span>]</p>
<p class="indent">Phew! I think we got away with it. Because the index starts at 0, when we inserted <span class="literal">Seal hatch</span>, we placed it at position 1, the second item in the list. The rest of the list items shifted down in the list to make room, increasing their index numbers, as shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig1">Figure 2-1</a>.</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig1"/><img src="../images/fig2-1.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-1: Inserting an item at index 1. Top row: before insertion. Bottom row: after insertion.</em></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev37"><strong>ACCESSING AN INDIVIDUAL ITEM</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You can also access a particular item in a list using the list name with the index number of the item you want to access in square brackets. For example, to print particular items in the list, you can enter the following:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist[0])<br/><span class="blue">Put on suit</span><br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist[1])<br/><span class="blue">Seal hatch</span><br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist[2])<br/><span class="blue">Check cabin pressure</span></p>
<p class="indent">Now you can see individual items in the list!</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37"/><strong><span class="notes">RED ALERT</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>Don’t mix up your brackets. Roughly speaking: Use square brackets when you’re telling Python which list item to use. Use parentheses when you’re doing something to the list or items in it, such as printing the list or appending items to it. Every opening bracket needs a closing bracket of the same type.</em></p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev38"><strong>REPLACING AN ITEM</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You can also replace an item if you know its index number. Simply enter the list name followed by the index of the item you want to replace, and then use an equal sign (<span class="literal">=</span>) to tell Python what you want at that index, like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> take_off_checklist[3] = <span class="green">"Take a selfie"</span><br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist)<br/><span class="blue">['Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Take a selfie', 'Tell<br/>Mission Control checks are complete']</span></p>
<p class="indent">The old item at index 3 is removed and replaced with the new item. Be aware that when you replace an item, Python forgets the original. Recall your training to put it back, like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> take_off_checklist[3] = <span class="green">"Fasten seatbelt"</span><br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist)<br/><span class="blue">['Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Fasten seatbelt', 'Tell<br/>Mission Control checks are complete']</span></p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev39"><strong>DELETING AN ITEM</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">If you know where an item is in a list, you can delete it using its index number too, like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">del</span> take_off_checklist[2]<br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(take_off_checklist)<br/><span class="blue">['Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Fasten seatbelt', 'Tell Mission Control checks<br/>are complete']</span></p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">"Check cabin pressure"</span> item disappears from the list.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="ch02sb1"><strong>TRAINING MISSION #1</strong></p>
<p class="spara">It’s time to practice your skills! We just deleted item 2 in the list. Can you insert it back into the list in the correct position? Print the list to check that it worked.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev40"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38"/><strong>CREATING THE SPACEWALK CHECKLIST</strong></h3>
<p class="noindentb">As you know from <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, another dangerous activity for an astronaut is venturing out into the black vacuum of space with just a suit to protect you and provide oxygen. Here is a checklist to help keep you safe when you’re spacewalking:</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Put on suit</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Check oxygen</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Seal helmet</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Test radio</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Open airlock</p>
<p class="indentt">Let’s make this checklist into a Python list. We’ll call it <span class="literal">spacewalk_checklist</span>, like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> spacewalk_checklist = [<span class="green">"Put on suit"</span>,<br/>                           <span class="green">"Check oxygen"</span>,<br/>                           <span class="green">"Seal helmet"</span>,<br/>                           <span class="green">"Test radio"</span>,<br/>                           <span class="green">"Open airlock"</span>]</p>
<p class="indent">Remember to be careful with the commas and brackets.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="ch02sb2"><strong>TRAINING MISSION #2</strong></p>
<p class="spara">It’s always a good idea to test your code so you know it’s working as it should. Can you try printing all the list items to check that they’re in the right place?</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev41"><strong>A LIST OF LISTS: THE FLIGHT MANUAL</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">We have two checklists now: one for take-off and one for spacewalking. We can organize them by putting them into another list to create our “flight manual.” Think of the flight manual as a folder that contains two sheets of paper, and each piece of paper has one list on it.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev42"><strong>MAKING A LIST OF LISTS</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Here is how we make the flight manual list of lists:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> flight_manual = [take_off_checklist, spacewalk_checklist]</p>
<p class="indent">We give IDLE the <span class="literal">flight_manual</span> list name, use the equal sign (<span class="literal">=</span>), and then add the two lists we want to put in the <span class="literal">flight_manual</span> list inside square brackets. As we did earlier when making lists, we separate the two items with a comma. The new <span class="literal">flight_manual</span> list has two items in it: the <span class="literal">take_off_checklist</span> <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39"/>and the <span class="literal">spacewalk_checklist</span>. When you print <span class="literal">flight_manual</span>, it looks like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(flight_manual)<br/><span class="blue">[['Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Fasten seatbelt',<br/>'Tell Mission Control checks are complete'], ['Put on suit', 'Check oxygen',<br/>'Seal helmet', 'Test radio', 'Open airlock']]</span></p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebart"><strong>TIP</strong></p>
<p class="spara">Remember that you don’t need to use quote marks around list names; you use them only when you’re entering text into a list.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">RED ALERT</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>If you don’t see</em> <span class="codeitalic">'Check cabin pressure'</span> <em>in your list, it’s because you skipped Training Mission #1. To make it easier to follow along, I recommend you go back and complete that mission. You can check the training mission answers at the end of the chapter if you need to.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">The output looks messy! To work out what’s going on, look closely at the brackets. Square brackets mark the start and end of each list. If you strip out the list items, the output looks like this:</p>
<p class="programs">[ [ <span class="codeitalic1">first list is here</span> ], [ <span class="codeitalic1">second list is here</span> ] ]</p>
<p class="indent">In the middle, you can see where the first list ends with a closed bracket followed by a comma before the next list begins with an opening bracket. So what happens when you try to print the first item in the <span class="literal">flight_manual</span> list?</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(flight_manual[0])</p>
<p class="indent">The first item is the <span class="literal">take_off_checklist</span>, so the output looks like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="blue">['Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Fasten seatbelt', 'Tell<br/>Mission Control checks are complete']</span></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="ch02sb3"><strong>TRAINING MISSION #3</strong></p>
<p class="spara">Try adding other checklists to <span class="literal">flight_manual</span> and printing them. For example, you could add a checklist for landing on a planet or docking with another spaceship.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev43"><strong>FINDING AN ITEM IN THE FLIGHT MANUAL</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">If you want to look at a particular item in one of the lists in <span class="literal">flight_manual</span>, you must give Python two pieces of information: the list the item is in, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40"/>the index of the item in the list, in that order. For each piece of information, you can use index numbers, like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(flight_manual[0][1])<br/><span class="blue">Seal hatch</span></p>
<p class="indent">Check your result against the printout of your checklist higher up in the shell. The <span class="literal">Seal hatch</span> item is in the first list (index 0), which is the <span class="literal">take_off_checklist</span>, and it’s the second item in that list (index 1). Those are the two index numbers we used to find it. Let’s choose an item from the second list:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(flight_manual[1][3])<br/><span class="blue">Test radio</span></p>
<p class="indent">This time, we’re printing from the second list (index 1), and from that list, we’re printing the fourth item (index 3). Although it might seem confusing that Python starts counting at 0, soon it will become second nature to subtract one from the position number you want. Be careful that you don’t end up buying one fewer of everything when you go shopping!</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebart"><strong>TIP</strong></p>
<p class="spara">To print a list or variable on the screen, you can leave out the <span class="literal">print()</span> command when you’re typing into the shell, like so:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> flight_manual[0][2]<br/><span class="blue">‘Check cabin pressure’</span></p>
<p class="spara1">This only works in the shell, though, and not in a program. Often, you’ll have many ways to do the same thing in Python. This book focuses on the techniques that will most help you make the <em>Escape</em> game. As you learn Python, you’ll find your own style and preferences.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev44"><strong>COMBINING LISTS</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You can join two lists using a plus sign (<span class="literal">+</span>) to combine them into a single list. Let’s make a list of all the skills needed for take-off and spacewalking and call it <span class="literal">skills_list</span>:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> skills_list = take_off_checklist + spacewalk_checklist<br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(skills_list)<br/><span class="blue">['Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Fasten seatbelt', 'Tell<br/>Mission Control checks are complete', 'Put on suit', 'Check oxygen', 'Seal<br/>helmet', 'Test radio', 'Open airlock']</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_41"/>The output you see here is a single list containing the skills astronauts need from the two lists we already made. We can also add more skills to the list by entering the combined list’s name and using <span class="literal">+=</span> to add single items or other lists to the end of it. (In <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>, you learned how to use <span class="literal">+=</span> to add a number to a variable’s value.)</p>
<p class="indent">Few people get to go into space, so a big part of an astronaut’s role is to share that experience. Let’s add a list called <span class="literal">pr_list</span> for public relations (PR) skills that an astronaut might need. I think there might be a place for selfie skills after all!</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> pr_list = [<span class="green">"Taking a selfie"</span>,<br/>               <span class="green">"Delivering lectures"</span>,<br/>               <span class="green">"Doing TV interviews"</span>,<br/>               <span class="green">"Meeting the public"</span>]<br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> skills_list += pr_list<br/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(skills_list)<br/><span class="blue">['Put on suit', 'Seal hatch', 'Check cabin pressure', 'Fasten seatbelt',<br/>'Tell Mission Control checks are complete', 'Put on suit', 'Check oxygen',<br/>'Seal helmet', 'Test radio', 'Open airlock', 'Taking a selfie', 'Delivering<br/>lectures', 'Doing TV interviews', 'Meeting the public']</span></p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">skills_list</span> now has the items from <span class="literal">pr_list</span> added. The <span class="literal">skills_list</span> is still just a single list with individual items in it, unlike <span class="literal">flight_manual</span>, which has two separate lists inside it.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebart"><strong>TIP</strong></p>
<p class="spara">You might have noticed that this code line:</p>
<p class="programs">skills_list += pr_list</p>
<p class="noindent">is just a shorter way of writing this:</p>
<p class="programs">skills_list = skills_list + pr_list</p>
<p class="spara1">It’s a very useful shortcut!</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev45"><strong>MAKING MAPS FROM LISTS: THE EMERGENCY ROOM</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Navigation is an essential skill for an astronaut. You must always know where you are, where your nearest sanctuary is, and even where the air is so you’re always ready in an emergency. The <em>Escape</em> game will keep a map of the room the player is in, so it can draw the room correctly and enable the player to interact with objects. Let’s look at how we can use lists to make a map of the emergency supplies room.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev46"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_42"/><strong>MAKING THE MAP</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now that you know how to manage lists and lists inside lists, you can make maps. This time, we’ll create a program rather than working in the shell. At the top of the Python window, select <strong>File</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>New File</strong> to open a new window.</p>
<p class="indent">Enter <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02list1">Listing 2-1</a> into your new program window:</p>

<p class="listing" id="ch02list1"><em>Listing 2-1: Setting up the emergency room</em></p>
<p class="indent">Note that you don’t need a comma at the end of the last line in the list. This program creates and displays a list called <span class="literal">room_map</span>. Our new emergency room is five meters by five meters. The <span class="literal">room_map</span> list contains five lists. Each of those lists contains five numbers, which represent one row of the map. I’ve lined up the numbers in the code so it looks like the grid shown in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a>, which shows a map of the room. Compare the diagram and the program; you’ll see that the first list is for the top row, the second list is for the second row, and so on. A 0 represents an empty space in the grid, and the numbers 1 to 4 are for various emergency items in the room. The numbers we’ll use in this chapter represent the following items:</p>
<div class="image"><a id="ch02fig2"/><img src="../images/fig2-2.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-2: Our first simple map</em></p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Click <strong>File</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>Save</strong> and save your program as <em>listing2-1.py</em>. This program doesn’t use Pygame Zero, so we can run it from IDLE. Click <strong>Run</strong> in the menu bar at the top of the window, and then click <strong>Run Module</strong>.

<p class="programs"><span class="blue">[[1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0],<br/>[0, 0, 0, 0, 4]]</span></p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43"/>It’s hard to work out what you’re looking at when the list is shown like this, which is why I lined up the numbers in a grid in the program listing. But this shell output is the same map and the same data, so everything is where it should be: it’s just being presented in a different way. In <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03">Chapter 3</a>, you’ll learn how to print this map data so it looks more like the listing we created.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev47"><strong>FINDING AN EMERGENCY ITEM</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">To find out what item is at a particular point in the map, you need to give Python a coordinate to check. The <em>coordinates</em> are a combination of the <em>y</em> position (from top to bottom) and the <em>x</em> position (from left to right), in that order. The <em>y</em> position will be the list in <span class="literal">room_map</span> you want to check (the row in the grid). The <em>x</em> position will be the item in that list you want to look at (the column) (see <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>). As always, remember that index numbers start at 0.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 2-3: The y-coordinate indicates the list we want to look at. The x-coordinate indicates the item in that list.</em></p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">RED ALERT</span></strong></p>
<p class="notep"><em>If you’ve used coordinates before, you know that you usually put the x-coordinate before the y-coordinate. We’re doing the opposite here because it makes the code simpler. If we put</em> x <em>first, we would have to make each list in</em> <span class="codeitalic">room_map</span> <em>represent a column of the map, from top to bottom, instead of a row, from left to right. That would make the map look wrong in our code: the map would be on its side and a mirror image, which would be very confusing! Just remember that our map coordinates use</em> y <em>and then</em> x<em>.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="indent">Let’s work through an example: we’ll find out what item is at the position marked 2 on our simple map diagram. We need to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li class="noindent">The <span class="literal">2</span> is in the second row (from top to bottom), so it’s in the second list in <span class="literal">room_map</span>. The index starts at 0, so we subtract 1 from 2 to get the index number for the <em>y</em> position, which is <span class="literal">1</span>. Use <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a> to check this index number: the index numbers for the rows are on the left of the grid in red.</li>
<li class="noindent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44"/>The <span class="literal">2</span> is in the fourth column (from left to right) of the list. Again, we subtract 1 to get the index number for the <em>x</em> position, which is <span class="literal">3</span>. Use <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a> to check this index number as well. The index numbers for the columns are shown across the top of the grid in red.</li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Go to the shell and enter the following <span class="literal">print()</span> command to view the number in that position on the map:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(room_map[1][3])<br/><span class="blue">2</span></p>
<p class="indent">As expected, the result is the number 2, which happens to be spare oxygen tanks. You’ve successfully navigated your first map!</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="ch02sb4"><strong>TRAINING MISSION #4</strong></p>
<p class="spara">Try to predict the output before you enter the following command into the shell:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(room_map[3][1])</p>
<p class="spara1">Refer to the map in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a> and your code listing to make your prediction. If you need more help, look at <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a>. Then check your answer by entering the instruction in the shell.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev48"><strong>SWAPPING ITEMS IN THE ROOM</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You can also change items in the room. Let’s check which item is at the top-left position of the map, using the shell again:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(room_map[0][0])<br/><span class="blue">1</span></p>
<p class="indent">The 1 is fertilizer. We don’t need fertilizer in the emergency room, so let’s change that item to emergency blankets in the map. We’ll use a 5 to represent them. Remember how we used an equal sign (<span class="literal">=</span>) to change the value of an item in a list? We can do the same to change the number in the map, like this:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> room_map[0][0] = 5</p>
<p class="indent">We enter the coordinates and then enter a new number to replace the original number. We can check that the code worked by printing the value at that coordinate again, which was 1 a moment ago. Let’s also print <span class="literal">room_map</span> and confirm that the emergency blankets appear in the correct position:</p>
<p class="programs"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(room_map[0][0])<br/><span class="blue">5</span><br/><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45"/><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="purple">print</span>(room_map)<br/><span class="blue">[[5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0,<br/>0, 4]]</span></p>
<p class="indent">Perfect! The emergency blankets are stored in the top-left corner of the room. Item 5 is the first item in the first list.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="ch02sb5"><strong>TRAINING MISSION #5</strong></p>
<p class="spara">Space is precious in the emergency room! Replace the toothpaste (4) with an emergency radio (6). You’ll need to find the coordinates of the 4 first and then enter the command to change it. Refer to <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig2">Figure 2-2</a> and <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02fig3">Figure 2-3</a> if you need more help with the index numbers.</p>

<p class="indent">In the <em>Escape</em> game, the <span class="literal">room_map</span> list is used to remember the items in the room the player is currently in. The map stores the number of the object that appears at each position on the map, or a 0 if the floor space is empty. The rooms in the game will be bigger than this 5 × 5 grid, so the size of the <span class="literal">room_map</span> will vary depending on the width and height of the room the player is in.</p>

<p class="noindentb">Check the following boxes to confirm that you’ve learned the key lessons in this chapter.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Python lists store words, numbers, or a mixture of both.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  To see an item in a list, use its index number in square brackets: for example, <span class="literal">print(take_off_checklist[2])</span>.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  The <span class="literal">append()</span> function adds items to the end of a list.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  The <span class="literal">remove()</span> function removes items from a list: for example, <span class="literal">spacewalk<br/>_checklist.remove("Seal helmet")</span>.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  You can use index numbers to delete or insert an item at a particular position in a list.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Index numbers start at 0.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  You can change an item in a list using the equal sign (<span class="literal">=</span>): for example, <span class="literal">take_off_checklist[3] = "Test comms"</span>.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  You can make a list that contains other lists to build a simple map.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  You can check which item is in your map using coordinates: for example, use <span class="literal">room_map[</span><span class="codeitalic">y coordinate</span><span class="literal">][</span><span class="codeitalic">x coordinate</span><span class="literal">]</span>.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  Be sure to use <em>y</em> first and then <em>x</em> for your coordinates. In space, everything is upside down.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  The coordinates are index numbers, so both start at 0, not 1.</p>
<p class="square"><img src="../images/box.jpg" alt="Images"/>  You can use <span class="literal">+=</span> to add an item to a list, or to join two lists.</p>
