    usually repeats until something changes. Often in a game, the `while` command
    will check a variable to decide whether to keep repeating instructions. For example,
    the instruction `while lives > 0` could keep a game going until the player runs
    out of lives. When the `lives` variable changes to 0, the instructions in the

    first index number says how far from the back of the room the objects are; the
    smaller the number the nearer to the back they are. The smallest useful number
    is usually 1 because the wall is in row 0.

- en: Because the *Explorer* program is just a demo, some things don’t work yet. For
    example, some objects have a black square under them because there’s no floor
    tile there. Also, all the rooms look the same because we’ve coded the objects
    into the `EXPLORER` section, so they appear in every room we display. This means
    you can’t view all the rooms anymore, because the objects won’t fit in some of
    them. As a result, you can’t use the arrow keys to look at all the rooms. The
    program doesn’t display wide objects such as the bed correctly yet, either. We’ll
    fix all of these problems later, but we can continue building and testing the
    space station in the meantime.
