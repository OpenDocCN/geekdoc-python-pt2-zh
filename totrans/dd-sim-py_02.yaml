    van Rossum. The name refers not to the snake often used as a mascot, but to *Monty
    Python’s Flying Circus* (that fact alone should tell you a lot about the mindset
    behind the language). What began as a hobby project over Christmas break turned
    into one of the most perennially popular computer languages today.

    naturally slower than compiled or low-level languages like C. In truth, it depends

    several concepts related to improving the performance of Python code.
  prefs: []

    in C, and it is indeed slower than native machine code. However, there are various
    libraries and techniques—as well as other implementations of the language, including
    PyPy—which have much better performance overall (see Chapter 21) and even approach
    the speed of native machine code.

    your project. In most situations, Python is plenty fast enough to be a good choice
    for application development, data analysis, scientific computing, game development,
    web development, and the list goes on. The performance drawbacks inherent in CPython
    usually only become problematic when you are dealing with very specific scenarios
    demanding extraordinarily high performance. Even then, there are ways around the
    bottlenecks. For the majority of projects, Python’s baseline performance is more

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    *Freeze* tool transpiles to C arrays of Python bytecode, and then it assembles
    this C code to machine code. This doesn’t result in truly assembled Python code,
    however, because the Python interpreter must still be invoked behind the scenes.
    Freeze only works on UNIX systems. The *cx_Freeze* tool, as well as *py2exe* on
    Windows, does much the same thing as Freeze.

    allows transpiling a specialized form of Python to C, although it’s primarily

    do the conversion to bytecode in advance, for performance reasons, generating
    *.pyc* files containing bytecode. While this is “compiling” in one sense of the
    term, there is a key difference between compiling to bytecode and compiling to
    machine code: bytecode is still run through the interpreter, whereas machine code
    executes directly, without needing an additional program. (Technically, “compiling”

    those situations, tools such as *PyInstaller* and *cx_Freeze* exist. These don’t
    compile the code, but rather bundle the Python source code or bytecode with the
