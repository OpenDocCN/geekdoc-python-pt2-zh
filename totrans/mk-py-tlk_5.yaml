- en: In this appendix, I’ll discuss the various modules for playing audio files in
    Python. While there is no feasible way to account for all the differences in hardware
    and operating system combinations, I have tested the instructions in this book
    on a variety of hardware and software platforms. In doing so, I encountered various
    problems, and I want to help you avoid those problems.

- en: 'There are two types of modules when it comes to playing audio files. The first
    type (which we can call *blocking*) will take control of the script and won’t
    let your execution move to the next line of code until the audio file is finished
    playing. We’ll discuss two modules in this category: *playsound* and *pydub*.
    You need to make only one of them work for this book. The second type won’t take
    control of the script; it simply moves on to the next line of code as soon as
    the audio file starts playing (we can refer to this as *non-blocking*). We’ll
    look at two modules in this category: *vlc* and *pygame*. Similarly, you need
    to make only one of them work for this book.'

- en: Both module types are used in this book. The blocking type is the most common,
    and we use it to play most audio files in our scripts. The non-blocking type is
    useful when the audio file is long and you want the option of pausing or stopping
    while it’s playing. We use this in Chapter 6 in the script *news_brief_hs.py*
    and in the music-playing functionality in our ultimate VPA script, *vpa_final.py*,
    in Chapter 17 .

    However, installing in Mac or Linux may be difficult, even though I have managed
    to install it in all three operating systems.
