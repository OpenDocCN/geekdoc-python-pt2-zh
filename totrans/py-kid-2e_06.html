<div class="image1"><img src="Images/common.jpg" alt="Image" width="600" height="230"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">In programming, we often ask yes or no questions, and do something based on the answer. For example, we might ask, “Are you older than 20?” and, if the answer is yes, respond with “You are too old!” These sorts of questions are called <em>conditions</em>, and we combine conditions and their responses into <span class="literal">if</span> statements. Conditions can be more complicated than a single question, and <span class="literal">if</span> statements can be combined with multiple questions and different responses based on the answer to each question. In this chapter, you’ll learn to use <span class="literal">if</span> statements to build programs.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56"/>If Statements</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We might write an <span class="literal">if</span> statement in Python like this:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 13&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age &gt; 20:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'You are too old!'</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">An <span class="literal">if</span> statement is made up of the <span class="literal">if</span> keyword, followed by a condition and a colon (<span class="literal">:</span>), as in this <span class="literal">if age &gt; 20:</span> statement. The lines following the colon must be in a block; if the answer to the question is yes (or <span class="literal">True</span>), the commands in the block will run. Now, let’s explore how to write blocks and conditions.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="Images/f0056-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="301" height="205"/></div>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em><span class="literal">True</span> is a</em> Boolean <em>value, named after mathematician George Boole. Booleans can only have one of two values: <span class="literal">True</span> or <span class="literal">False</span>.</em></p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec2">A Block Is a Group of Programming Statements</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>block</em> of code is a grouped set of programming statements. For example, when <span class="literal">if age &gt; 20:</span> is <span class="literal">True</span>, you might want to do more than just print “You are too old!” Perhaps you want to print out more sentences, like this:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 25&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age &gt; 20:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'You are too old!'</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Why are you here?'</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Why aren\'t you mowing a lawn or sorting papers?'</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_57"/>This block of code is made up of three <span class="literal">print</span> calls that are run only if the condition <span class="literal">age &gt; 20</span> is found to be <span class="literal">True</span>. Each line in the block has four spaces at the beginning. Let’s look at that code again, with visible spaces:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 25&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age &gt; 20:&#13;
 .... <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'You are too old!'</span>)&#13;
 .... <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Why are you here?'</span>)&#13;
 .... <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Why aren\'t you mowing a lawn or sorting papers?'</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">In Python, <em>whitespace</em>—such as a tab (inserted when you press the TAB key) or a space (inserted when you press the spacebar)—is meaningful. Code that is at the same position (or indented the same number of spaces from the left margin) is grouped into a block. Whenever you start a new line with more spaces than the previous one, you are starting a new block. This new block is also part of the previous block, like <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig01">Figure 5-1</a>.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch05fig01"><img src="Images/05fig01.jpg" alt="Image" width="511" height="304"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 5-1: How blocks of code work</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We group statements into blocks because they are related and need to be run together. When you change the indentation of code, you’re generally creating new blocks. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05fig02">Figure 5-2</a> shows how three blocks are created just by changing the indentation.</p>&#13;
<div class="image" id="ch05fig02"><img src="Images/05fig02.jpg" alt="Image" width="410" height="305"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_58"/><em>Figure 5-2: A second example showing how blocks of code work</em></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here, even though blocks 2 and 3 have the same indentation, they are considered different blocks because there is a block with less indentation (fewer spaces) between them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">A block with four spaces on one line and six spaces on the next will produce an <em>indentation error</em> when you run it. This is because Python expects you to use the same number of spaces for all lines in a block. Here’s an example:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age &gt; 20:&#13;
 .... <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'You are too old!'</span>)&#13;
 ...... <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Why are you here?'</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">I’ve made the spaces visible so you can see the differences. Notice that the second <span class="literal">print</span> line has six spaces instead of four. When we try to run this code, Python highlights the problem line with a red block and displays an explanatory <span class="literal">SyntaxError</span> message:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 25&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age &gt; 20:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'You are too old!'</span>)&#13;
          <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Why are you here?'</span>)&#13;
<span class="red">SyntaxError: unexpected indent</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python didn’t expect to see two extra spaces at the beginning of the second <span class="literal">print</span> line.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_59"/><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Use consistent spacing to make your code easier to read. If you start writing a program and put four spaces at the beginning of a block, keep using four spaces at the beginning of the other blocks in your program. Be sure to indent each line in one block with the same number of spaces.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec3">Conditions Help Us Compare Things</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>condition</em> is a programming expression that compares things and tells us whether the criteria set by the comparison are <span class="literal">True</span> (yes) or <span class="literal">False</span> (no). For example, <span class="literal">age &gt; 10</span> is a condition that asks, “Is the value of the <span class="literal">age</span> variable greater than 10?” Another condition might be <span class="literal">hair_color == ’mauve’</span>, or, “Is the value of the <span class="literal">hair_color</span> variable mauve?”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">We use symbols in Python—called <em>operators</em>—to create our conditions, such as <em>equal to</em>, <em>greater than</em>, and <em>less than</em>. <a href="ch05.xhtml#ch05tab01">Table 5-1</a> lists common operators.</p>&#13;

<p class="indent">For example, if you are 10 years old, the condition <span class="literal">your_age == 10</span> would return <span class="literal">True</span>; otherwise, it would return <span class="literal">False</span>. If you are 12 years old, the condition <span class="literal">your_age &gt; 10</span> would return <span class="literal">True</span>.</p>&#13;

<p class="notep"><em>Be sure to use a double equal sign (<span class="literal">==</span>) when defining an equal-to condition.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s try some examples. Here, we set our age as equal to 10 and then write a conditional statement that will print “You are too old for my jokes!” if <span class="literal">age</span> is greater than 10:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 10&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age &gt; 10:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'You are too old for my jokes!'</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_60"/>What happens when we type this into the Python Shell and press ENTER?</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Nothing.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because the value returned by <span class="literal">age</span> is not greater than 10, Python does not run the <span class="literal">print</span> block. However, if we had set <span class="literal">age</span> to 20, the message would print.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now let’s change the previous example to use a greater-than-or-equal-to (<span class="literal">&gt;=</span>) condition:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="Images/f0060-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="181" height="264"/></div>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 10&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age &gt;= 10:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'You are too old for my jokes!'</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You should see “You are too old for my jokes!” printed to the screen because the value of <span class="literal">age</span> is equal to 10.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, let’s try using an equal-to (<span class="literal">==</span>) condition:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 10&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age == 10:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"What's brown and sticky? A stick!!"</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You should see the message “What’s brown and sticky? A stick!!” printed to the screen.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec4">If-Then-Else Statements</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In addition to using <span class="literal">if</span> statements to do something when a condition is met (<span class="literal">True</span>), we can also use <span class="literal">if</span> statements to do something when a condition is not true. For example, we might print one message to the screen if your age is 12 and another if it’s not 12.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The trick here is to use an if-then-else statement, which essentially says, “If something is true, then do this; else, do that.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s create an if-then-else statement. Enter the following into the Python Shell:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Want to hear a dirty joke?'</span>)&#13;
Want to hear a dirty joke?&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 12&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age == 12:&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_61"/>        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'A pig fell in the mud!'</span>)&#13;
    <span class="orange">else</span>:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"Shh. It's a secret."</span>)&#13;
&#13;
<span class="blue">A pig fell in the mud!</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because we’ve set <span class="literal">age</span> to 12, and the condition is asking whether <span class="literal">age</span> is equal to 12, you should see the first <span class="literal">print</span> message on the screen. Now try changing the value of <span class="literal">age</span> to a number other than 12, like this:</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="Images/f0061-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="210" height="176"/></div>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Want to hear a dirty joke?'</span>)&#13;
Want to hear a dirty joke?&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 8&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age == 12:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'A pig fell in the mud!'</span>)&#13;
    <span class="orange">else</span>:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"Shh. It's a secret."</span>)&#13;
&#13;
<span class="blue">Shh. It's a secret.</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">This time, you should see the second <span class="literal">print</span> message.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec5">IF AND ELIF STATEMENTS</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">We can extend an <span class="literal">if</span> statement even further with <span class="literal">elif</span>, which is short for <em>else-if</em>. These statements differ from if-then-else statements in that there can be more than one <span class="literal">elif</span> in the same statement. For example, we can check if a person’s age is 10, 11, or 12 (and so on) and have our program do something different based on the answer:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 12&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age == 10:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'What do you call an unhappy cranberry?'</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'A blueberry!'</span>)&#13;
    <span class="orange">elif</span> age == 11:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'What did the green grape say to the blue grape?'</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Breathe! Breathe!'</span>)&#13;
    <span class="orange">elif</span> age == 12:&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_62"/>        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'What did 0 say to 8?'</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Hi guys!'</span>)&#13;
    <span class="orange">elif</span> age == 13:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"Why wasn't 10 afraid of 7?"</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Because rather than eating 9, 7 8 pi.'</span>)&#13;
    <span class="orange">else</span>:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Huh?'</span>)&#13;
&#13;
<span class="blue">What did 0 say to 8?&#13;
Hi guys!</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">In this example, the <span class="literal">if</span> statement on the second line checks if the value of <span class="literal">age</span> is equal to 10. If so, the <span class="literal">print</span> function that follows is run. However, because we’ve set <span class="literal">age</span> equal to 12, the computer jumps to the next part of the <span class="literal">if</span> statement (the first <span class="literal">elif</span> or <em>else if</em>) and checks if the value of <span class="literal">age</span> is equal to 11. It isn’t, so the computer jumps to the next <span class="literal">elif</span> to see if <span class="literal">age</span> is equal to 12. It is, so this time the computer executes the following <span class="literal">print</span> call.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">When you enter this code in IDLE, it will automatically indent, so be sure to press the BACKSPACE key (or DELETE key if you’re using a Mac) once you’ve typed each <span class="literal">print</span> statement. That way, your <span class="literal">if</span>, <span class="literal">elif</span>, and <span class="literal">else</span> statements will start at the far-left margin. This is the same position the <span class="literal">if</span> statement would be in, if the prompt (<span class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>) were absent.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="Images/f0062-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="233" height="163"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec6">Combining Conditions</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can combine conditions using the keywords <span class="literal">and</span> and <span class="literal">or</span>, which produces shorter and simpler code. Here’s an example using <span class="literal">or</span>:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age == 10 <span class="orange">or</span> age == 11 <span class="orange">or</span> age == 12 <span class="orange">or</span> age == 13:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'What is 13 + 49 + 84 + 155 + 97? A headache!'</span>)&#13;
    <span class="orange">else</span>:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Huh?'</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_63"/>In this code, if any of the conditions on the first line are true (if <span class="literal">age</span> is 10, 11, 12, or 13), the <span class="literal">print</span> statement on the following line will run.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If the conditions in the first line are not true (<span class="literal">else</span>), Python displays <span class="literal">Huh?</span> on the screen.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To shrink this example even further, we could use the <span class="literal">and</span> keyword, along with the greater-than-or-equal-to operator (<span class="literal">&gt;=</span>) and less-than-or-equal-to operator (<span class="literal">&lt;=</span>), as follows:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age &gt;= 10 <span class="orange">and</span> age &lt;= 13:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'What is 13 + 49 + 84 + 155 + 97? A headache!'</span>)&#13;
    <span class="orange">else</span>:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">'Huh?'</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here, if <span class="literal">age</span> is greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 13, the <span class="literal">print</span> statement on the following line will run. For example, if the value of <span class="literal">age</span> is 12, then <span class="literal">What is 13 + 49 + 84 + 155 + 97? A</span> <span class="literal">headache!</span> will be printed to the screen because 12 is more than 10 and less than 13.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="Images/f0063-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="226" height="230"/></div>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec7">Variables with No Value—None</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Just as we can assign numbers, strings, and lists to a variable, we can also assign nothing, or an empty value. In Python, an empty value is referred to as <span class="literal">None</span>. It’s important to note that the value <span class="literal">None</span> is different from the value <span class="literal">0</span> because it is the <em>absence</em> of a value rather than a number with a value of 0. Here’s an example where we set a variable to <span class="literal">None</span>:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> myval = <span class="violet">None</span>&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(myval)&#13;
<span class="blue">None</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Assigning <span class="literal">None</span> to a variable tells Python that the variable no longer has any value (or rather, that it no longer labels a value). It’s also a way to define a variable without setting its value. This might be useful when you know you’ll need a variable later in your program but you want to define all variables at the beginning.</p>&#13;
<div class="note">&#13;
<p class="notet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_64"/><strong><span class="notes">NOTE</span></strong></p>&#13;
<p class="notep"><em>Programmers often define their variables at the beginning of a program (or a function) to have a quick reference of all the variables used in a chunk of code.</em></p>&#13;
</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can check for <span class="literal">None</span> in an <span class="literal">if</span> statement as well, as in the following example:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> myval = <span class="violet">None</span>&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> myval <span class="orange">is</span> <span class="violet">None</span>:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"The variable myval doesn't have a value"</span>)&#13;
&#13;
<span class="blue">The variable myval doesn't have a value</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">This is useful when you want to calculate a value for a variable only if it hasn’t already been calculated yet. In this scenario, checking for <span class="literal">None</span> tells Python to do the calculation only if the variable doesn’t have a value.</p>&#13;

<p class="noindent"><em>User input</em> is what a person enters on the keyboard—whether that’s a character, a pressed arrow or ENTER key, or anything else. In Python, user input is a string, meaning when you type the number 10 on your keyboard, Python saves the number 10 as a string, not a number.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Compare the number 10 and the string <span class="literal">'10'</span>. While we see the only difference between the two being that one is surrounded by quotes, to a computer, they are completely different.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, let’s compare the value of the variable <span class="literal">age</span> to a number in an <span class="literal">if</span> statement, like so:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age == 10:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"What's the best way to speak to a monster?"</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"From as far away as possible!"</span>)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">If we set the variable <span class="literal">age</span> to the number <span class="literal">10</span> first:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 10&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age == 10:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"What's the best way to speak to a monster?"</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"From as far away as possible!"</span>)&#13;
        &#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_65"/><span class="blue">What's the best way to speak to a monster?&#13;
From as far away as possible!</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">As you can see, the <span class="literal">print</span> statement executes.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Next, we set <span class="literal">age</span> to the string <span class="literal">‘10’</span> (with quotes), like this:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = <span class="green">'10'</span>&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> age == 10:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"What's the best way to speak to a monster?"</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"From as far away as possible!"</span>)&#13;
&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Here, the <span class="literal">print</span> statement doesn’t run because Python doesn’t see the string as a number.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="Images/f0065-01.jpg" alt="Image" width="211" height="194"/></div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Fortunately, Python has functions that can turn strings into numbers and numbers into strings. For example, you can convert the string <span class="literal">‘10’</span> into a number with the <span class="literal">int</span> function:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = <span class="green">'10'</span>&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> converted_age = <span class="violet">int</span>(age)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The variable <span class="literal">converted_age</span> now holds the number 10 (rather than a string).</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To convert a number into a string, use <span class="literal">str</span> like so:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = 10&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> converted_age = <span class="violet">str</span>(age)</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Now <span class="literal">converted_age</span> holds the string <span class="literal">‘10’</span> instead of the number 10.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Remember the <span class="literal">if age == 10</span> statement that didn’t print anything when the variable was set to a string (<span class="literal">age = ’10’</span>)? If we convert the variable first, we get an entirely different result:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = <span class="green">'10'</span>&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> converted_age = <span class="violet">int</span>(age)&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">if</span> converted_age == 10:&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"What's the best way to speak to a monster?"</span>)&#13;
        <span class="violet">print</span>(<span class="green">"From as far away as possible!"</span>)&#13;
&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_66"/><span class="blue">What's the best way to speak to a monster?&#13;
From as far away as possible!</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">But know this: if you try to convert a number with a decimal point (also called <em>floating point numbers</em>, because the dot can “move” around in a number), you’ll get an error because the <span class="literal">int</span> function expects an <em>integer</em> (a number without a decimal place):</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = <span class="green">'10.5'</span>&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> converted_age = <span class="violet">int</span>(age)&#13;
<span class="red">Traceback (most recent call last):&#13;
    File "&lt;pyshell#35&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;&#13;
    converted_age = int(age)&#13;
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '10.5'</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Python sends a <span class="literal">ValueError</span> to tell you that the value you’ve tried to use isn’t appropriate. To fix this, use <span class="literal">float</span> instead of <span class="literal">int</span>, as the <span class="literal">float</span> function can handle numbers that aren’t integers:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = <span class="green">'10.5'</span>&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> converted_age = <span class="violet">float</span>(age)&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="violet">print</span>(converted_age)&#13;
<span class="blue">10.5</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">You’ll also get a <span class="literal">ValueError</span> if you try to convert a string that doesn’t contain a number in digits:</p>&#13;
<pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> age = <span class="green">'ten'</span>&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> converted_age = <span class="violet">int</span>(age)&#13;
<span class="red">Traceback (most recent call last):&#13;
    File "&lt;pyshell#1&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;&#13;
    converted_age = int(age)}&#13;
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'ten'</span></pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because we used the word <span class="literal">ten</span> rather than the number <span class="literal">10</span>, Python throws up its hands.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch05lev1sec9"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_67"/>What You Learned</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">In this chapter, you learned to use <span class="literal">if</span> statements to create blocks of code that are executed only when particular conditions are true. You saw how to extend <span class="literal">if</span> statements by using <span class="literal">elif</span> so that different sections of code will execute as a result of different conditions, and how to use the <span class="literal">else</span> keyword to execute code if none of the conditions turn out to be true.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You combined conditions by using the <span class="literal">and</span> and <span class="literal">or</span> keywords to check if numbers fall in a range, and changed strings into numbers with the <span class="literal">int</span>, <span class="literal">str</span>, and <span class="literal">float</span> functions. You also discovered that <span class="literal">None</span> can reset variables to their initial, empty state.</p>&#13;
