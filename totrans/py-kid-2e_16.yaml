- en: It’s a good idea to develop a plan when creating a game (or any program). Your
    plan should include a description of what the game is about, as well as major
    elements and characters. When it’s time to start programming, your description
    will help keep you focused on what you are trying to develop. Your game might
    not turn out exactly like the original description—this is to be expected! In
    this chapter, we’ll begin developing a fun game called *Mr. Stick Man Races for
    the Exit*.

    Sprites are usually *pre-rendered*, meaning they’re drawn in advance (before the
    program runs) rather than created by the program itself using polygons, as in
    our *Bounce!* game. In this game, Mr. Stick Man, the platforms, and the door will
    be sprites. To create these images, we’ll need to install a graphics program.'

- en: There are several graphics programs available, but for this game, we need one
    that supports *transparency* (sometimes called the *alpha channel*), which lets
    images have sections where no colors are drawn on the screen. We need images with
    transparent parts because when one image passes over or near another as it moves
    across the screen, we don’t want the background of one image to wipe out part
    of another. For example, in [Figure 13-1](ch13.xhtml#ch13fig01), the checkerboard
    pattern in the background represents the transparent area.
