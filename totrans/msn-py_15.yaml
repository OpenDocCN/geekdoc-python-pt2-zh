    should look out for.

    the program, try copying and pasting the new bits from my listing into your program.

- en: Indentation is used to tell Python which bits of the program belong together.
    For example, all the instructions that belong to a function need to be indented
    underneath the def instruction that defines the function. Instructions that belong
    to a while, for, if, or else command need to be indented too. Listing C-1 provides
    an example, part of the get_floor_type() function.

- en: All the instructions belong to the function get_floor_type() ➊, so they’re all
    indented by at least four spaces (see ➋ and ➍). The return instructions (➌ and
    ➎) also belong to the if ➋ and else ➍ commands above them, so they’re indented
    by another four spaces, making eight spaces in total. When you add the colon at
    the end of the line when typing in the def, if, and else instructions, the indentation
    on the next line is added automatically in IDLE. Use the DELETE key to remove
    indentation you don’t need.

- en: If you get the indentation level wrong for some instructions, the program might
    behave strangely or simply run slower, even if Python doesn’t report any errors.
    So it’s worth double-checking your indentation levels.
  id: totrans-18

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If Python does give an error that shows it expected an indented block, it means
    you haven’t indented something that you should have. If Python tells you there’s
    an unexpected indent, you’ve added too many spaces at the start of the instruction,
    or you might have instructions indented at different levels that should be lined
    up. In this book, I’ve used four spaces for each level of indentation.
