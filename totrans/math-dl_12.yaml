    the sort of math needed to follow what deep learning is and how it operates. We’ve
    done just that in the previous 11 chapters.

    only waded in the tide pools, which are fascinating enough, but in the depths,
    you’ll find still more beauty and elegance. What follows are pointers to help
    you get more out of the topics we covered.

    learning portion covers what I call “classic machine learning” with some mention
    of deep learning.'

- en: We discussed calculus in [Chapters 7](ch07.xhtml#ch07) and [8](ch08.xhtml#ch08),
    but we limited ourselves to differentiation only. Calculus is, of course, much
    more than differentiation. The other primary part of calculus is integration.
    We ignored integration because deep learning seldom uses it. Convolution is integration
    when working with continuous variables, but most integrals become summations in
    the digital world. The references listed here will fill in the gaps in our cursory
    treatment.
