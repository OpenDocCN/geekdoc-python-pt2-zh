    *Escape* game includes 50 locations. If you had to enter `room_map` data for every
    location, it would take ages and be hugely inefficient. As an example, if each
    room consisted of 9 × 9 tiles, we would have 81 data items per room, or 4,050

    so we only need to store the location of an exit from one side of the wall. For
    instance, an exit on the right of room 31 and an exit on the left of room 32 would
    be the same doorway connecting the two rooms. We don’t need to specify that exit
    for both rooms. For each room in the map, we’ll store whether it has an exit at
    the top or on the right. The program can work out on its own whether an exit exists
    at the bottom or on the left (as I’ll explain shortly). This approach also ensures

    type for the room. Functions can send information back to other parts of the program
    using the `return` instruction, as you can see in this function. The `get_floor_type()`
    function checks whether the `current_room` value is in the `outdoor_rooms` range.
    If so, the function returns the number 2, which represents Martian soil. Otherwise,
    it returns the number 0, which represents a tiled floor. This check is in a separate
    function so other parts of the program can use it too. The `generate_map()` function
    puts the number that `get_floor_type()` returns into the `floor_type` variable.
    Using one instruction ➌, `generate_map()` sets up the `floor_type` variable to
    be equal to whatever `get_floor_type()` sends back, and it tells the `get_floor_type()`
    function to run now too.

    The side edge material is used for the top, left, and right sides, and the bottom
