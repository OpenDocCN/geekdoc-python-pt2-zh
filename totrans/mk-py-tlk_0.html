<p class="ChapterIntro">Python is currently the world’s most popular coding language, having overtaken more long established languages like Java and C. Once you start to code in Python, it’s easy to see why. The two main advantages of Python are its simplicity and openness. Python code is relatively close to plain English, so with only a little experience, you can often guess what a script is trying to accomplish. </p>
<p>Python is open source, meaning not only that the software is free to use for everyone but also that other users can create and alter libraries. In fact, Python has a vast ecosystem from which you can get resources and help from members in the community. Python programmers can share their code with one another, so instead of building everything from scratch, you can import modules designed by others, as well as share your modules with others in the Python community.</p>
<p>When people heard that I was writing a Python book on speech recognition and text to speech, their reaction was generally the same: “I thought <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xx" id="Page_xx"/>you were a <em>finance</em> professor.” My typical answer is the Hugo Banziger quote that opens this chapter, made shortly after the 2008 financial crisis. Nowadays, you can replace <em>banks</em> with corporations in any other industry—car manufacturers, retailers, anything really—and the quote still rings true. Technology is in every aspect of our lives these days. The future is here and now.</p>
<p>Python has been the world’s most popular coding language since 2018. Long before that, Python was the leading programming language in the finance world, with applications in financial services, portfolio management, algorithmic trading, cryptocurrency, and so on. </p>

<p>	The article “Python Is Becoming the World’s Most Popular Coding Language” in <em>The Economist</em> (<a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/07/26/python-is-becoming-the-worlds-most-popular-coding-language" class="LinkURL">https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/07/26/python-is-becoming-the-worlds-most-popular-coding-language</a><a href="http:///" class="LinkURL">/</a>) has details on the increasing popularity of Python.</p>

<p>When talking to potential employers of my Master of Science in Finance (MSF) students, I was told that they have people who know finance, but not coding—and people who know coding, but nothing about finance. They wanted to hire people who understood both. As a result, we started to incorporate Python into the MSF curriculum.</p>
<p>The reactions from the finance students were mixed. Many students found Python user-friendly and versatile, while others wondered why they needed to bother learning Python when they could do everything in Microsoft Excel. So I started to show them cool skills in Python that are impossible in Excel, such as obtaining real-time stock prices via voice commands, creating a talking graphical US stock market watch, and so on. I wanted to show that Python can accomplish more than Excel, that the barrier to entry is not very high, and most important, that it’s fun!</p>
<p>In this book, I focus on speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality in fun and genuinely useful applications, such as a voice translator, a voice-controlled online radio, a virtual personal assistant, voice-controlled graphical games, and so on. My aim is to teach Python skills that are applicable and adaptable in real life, while keeping the skeptical students of Python interested in what they’re doing.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501560f06-0001">	About This Book</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This book both <em>is</em> and <em>isn’t</em> an introductory book on Python. While it’s not intended as a full tutorial in Python basics, it is written simply enough that a total beginner can follow along. You’ll learn how to install Python on your computer and write your very first script. You’ll also learn the basic rules of Python, how functions and modules work, and various data types every Python user needs to know. With this, you’ll be able to accomplish most simple tasks in Python.</p>
<p>At the same time, this book <em>isn’t</em> an introductory book in Python. I’ll provide a Python refresher that will prepare you for later chapters, but it isn’t a comprehensive introduction. Several wonderful books cover all the basics of Python. One example is <em>Python Crash Course</em> by Eric Matthes (No Starch Press, 2019). </p>
<p><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxi" id="Page_xxi"/>Beyond the refresher, the purpose of this book is to improve your skills and build real working applications you can use in your daily life. This book also eases you into more advanced topics, such as making your own Python modules and packages. In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 3">Chapter 3</span>, you’ll learn how to use a function in a self-made module to contain all speech recognition functionality and related code so that you don’t have to repeat the code every time you convert speech to text. In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Chapter 5">Chapter 5</span>, you’ll create a package from which you can import the function in the module to convert speech to text in all chapters that need this feature (which is pretty much all the remaining chapters in the book). Along the way, you’ll learn how Python modules and packages work.</p>
<p>The end-of-chapter exercises are a great tool for practicing concepts and checking that you really understand them. You’ll find the answers at the end of the book. </p>
<p>The code in this book is all cross-platform, so it should work in Windows, Mac, or Linux. I’ll address the differences in the three operating systems whenever there are any.</p>
<h2 id="h1-501560f06-0002">	What’s in This Book?</h2>
<p class="BodyFirst">This book is divided into four parts. <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Part I">Part I</span> discusses how to install Python, as well as the basic Python rules and skills you’ll need in later chapters. <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Part II">Part II</span> introduces you to speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality, including how to install and fine-tune the required modules. You’ll also use the speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities to create a virtual personal assistant. </p>
<p><span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Part III">Part III</span> covers interactive games. You’ll learn to create graphical games and add text-to-speech and speech recognition features to make them talk and take voice commands. In <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Part IV">Part IV</span>, we build some applications to follow the financial markets, and we’ll see how to make Python talk and listen in major world languages. The last chapter of the book builds our ultimate virtual assistant by adding the interactive games and the voice translator to it. Here’s an overview of the book:</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Part I: Getting Started</b></p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 1: Setting Up Python, Anaconda, and Spyder</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll install the Python software required for the book and start running Python scripts, even if you know nothing about coding. We’ll also talk about basic operations in Python. </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 2: Python Refresher</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll learn how to use the built-in Python functions and how to import modules in the Python Standard Library. You’ll then learn how functions and modules work and how to create your own. I’ll discuss ways of installing these modules on your computer. Finally, you’ll learn about virtual environments, their uses, and how to create and activate them. </p>
<p class="ListBody">Python uses strings, lists, dictionaries, and tuples as collections of elements to accomplish certain tasks. In this chapter, you’ll learn about these four types of collections and see examples of their uses. </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxii" id="Page_xxii"/>Part II: Learning to Talk</b></p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 3: Speech Recognition</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll install modules related to speech recognition in Python, then create a script to have Python recognize your speech and print it out. You’ll use voice control to complete several tasks, such as taking voice dictation, opening web browsers, opening files, and playing music on your computer. To save space in your scripts, you’ll learn how to put all code related to speech recognition into a custom local module so that the final script is concise, short, and clean. </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 4: Make Python Talk</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">Here, you’ll learn how to make Python talk back to you in a human voice. You’ll install the text-to-speech module and teach Python to speak aloud whatever you enter into Spyder. We’ll also add the speech recognition feature and get Python to repeat whatever you say. We’ll store all code related to text-to-speech functionality in another custom module. </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 5: Speaking Applications</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll put the speech recognition and text-to-speech functionality from Chapters <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_3">3</span> and <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_4">4</span> to use in a couple of applications. First, you’ll parse text to extract news summaries from National Public Radio (NPR) and have Python read them out to you. You’ll also build a script to extract information from Wikipedia based on your voice inquiries and speak the answers. Finally, you’ll learn how to traverse files in a folder with your voice, with the aim of building your very own Alexa. You’ll be able to say, “Python, play Selena Gomez,” and a song by Selena Gomez that’s saved on your computer will play.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 6: Web Scraping Podcasts, Radios, and Videos</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll learn the basics of web scraping. I’ll cover how HyperText Markup Language (HTML) works to construct web pages. You’ll parse HTML files and extract information. Then you’ll use these skills to voice-activate podcasts, live radio stations, and videos on various websites.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 7: Building a Virtual Personal Assistant</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll create your own virtual personal assistant (VPA), similar to Amazon’s Alexa. Whenever you need assistance, you can say “Hello, Python” to wake up your VPA; you’ll also use voice commands to put it in standby mode. The VPA can act as a timer and an alarm clock, tell jokes, and send email 100 percent hands-free.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 8: Know-It-All VPA</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">Here you’ll add know-it-all functionality to your VPA. Specifically, you’ll tap into the vast knowledge base in the computational engine WolframAlpha and use Wikipedia as a backup if WolframAlpha can’t answer your question. Your know-it-all VPA is capable of answering almost any question for you.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b><span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxiii" id="Page_xxiii"/>Part III: Interactive Games</b></p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 9: Graphics and Animation with the Turtle Module</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">Our goal in <span class="xref" itemid="xref_target_Part III">Part III</span> is to build voice-controlled graphical games such as tic-tac-toe, Connect Four, and guess-the-word. You’ll do all these in the <em>turtle</em> module. In this chapter, you’ll learn the basic <em>turtle</em> commands that will let you set up a turtle screen, draw shapes, and create animations.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 10: Tic-Tac-Toe</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll build a voice-controlled tic-tac-toe game to put all the new skills you’ve learned so far into practice. You’ll draw a game board, check for valid moves, and detect if a player has won. You’ll then add the speech recognition and text-to-speech features and set up the game so you play against your own computer. </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 11: Connect Four</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll next build a voice-controlled Connect Four game. You’ll draw the board, animate the effect of a disc falling from the top of a column to the lowest available cell, and use Python logic to enforce a new set of game rules. Then you’ll add speech functionality to the game.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 12: Guess-the-Word Game</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll build a voice-controlled, graphical guess-the-word game that is an adaptation of the popular hangman game. This is an interesting challenge because when playing guess-the-word, players often exchange information verbally at a fast pace, so you’ll need to fine-tune the script’s listening abilities. </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 13: Smart Games: Adding Intelligence </b></p>
<p class="ListBody">In the one-player version of tic-tac-toe or Connect Four, the computer always randomly selects a move. In this chapter, we’ll build smart games by using two techniques that will get you to think about how to break down and solve problems in programming. The first is the think-three-steps-ahead approach, which has the computer following the path that most likely leads to a victory after three moves. The second method uses machine learning. You’ll simulate a million games in which both players select random moves. With this data, the computer will learn at each move and select the one most likely to lead to a winning outcome.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Part IV: Going Further</b></p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 14: Financial Applications</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">These programming skills and speech recognition and text-to-speech techniques can be applied to any aspect of your life. Here, I’ll show you how to adapt your skills to monitoring the financial markets. You’ll then be able to generalize these techniques and apply them to your <span epub:type="pagebreak" title="xxiv" id="Page_xxiv"/>own area of interest, whatever that may be. You’ll build three projects: an app that tells you the up-to-date stock price of any publicly traded company; a script that builds visualizations of stock prices; and an app that uses recent daily stock prices to calculate returns, run regressions, and perform detailed analyses.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 15: Stock Market Watch</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll create a graphical, speaking app that watches the US stock market live and updates you aloud whenever a chosen stock exceeds certain preset thresholds. To build the necessary skills, you’ll first create a graphical Bitcoin watch by using <em>tkinter</em> to display live price information. </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 16: Use World Languages</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">So far, we’ve taught Python how to speak and listen in English. But Python can understand many other world languages. In this chapter, you’ll first teach Python to talk in several other languages with the modules you’ve been using. I’ll then introduce a useful module called <em>translate</em>, which can translate one language to another. You’ll use it to build a translator that changes whatever you speak into another language of your choice.</p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Chapter 17: Ultimate Virtual Personal Assistant</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">You’ll load up your virtual personal assistant with the interesting projects in this book, like voice-controlled games, translators, music players, and so on. You’ll first add a chatting functionality to the VPA so you can carry out a daily conversation with the script. The whole idea of a VPA is its convenience, so we’ll adjust these projects so that all added functionalities are 100 percent hands-free. </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Appendix A: Install Modules to Play Audio Files</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">Since the focus of the book is on making Python talk and listen, playing audio files is important. This appendix presents a few modules you can use to play audio files, along with their advantages and disadvantages. </p>
<p class="ListHead"><b>Appendix B: Answers to End-of-Chapter Exercises</b></p>
<p class="ListBody">This appendix provides suggested answers to all the exercises at the end of the chapters. You can use these answers to check your own and for help if you get stuck on any of the questions. </p>
