			<p class="ChapterIntro">When I first encountered programming code, I stared, amazed and bewildered, at a screen of obscure commands and symbols and wondered how anybody could understand it, let alone write it. I’d hit the F5 key, and the program would magically spawn a cityscape in which two players, depicted as gorillas, could hurl explosive bananas at each other. I tried changing a few lines to see what would happen, and on occasion, it was something predictable or cool. More often than not, the game would simply fail to run. In a futile attempt to be helpful, the computer would diagnose my errors, rambling on about syntax and “illegal” operations of varying description.</p>
			<p>
				For some years thereafter, I was content to avoid learning to program. That began to change when I became interested in making my creative work more interactive. You may already have encountered a few of the same <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xvi" title="xvi"/>barriers that frustrated me. Maybe you were getting by just fine with visual tools but then hit a wall. Or to your disappointment (and horror?), you discovered that what you sought to accomplish required delving into code.</p>
			<p>Software applications, with all of their graphical widgets, make us feel like we’re in control. The illusion, however, soon fades when you discover that the tool you desire is missing. Through learning to program, you gain a true mastery of your computer.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-500969f05-0001">Who Is This Book For?</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">This book assumes no prior programming experience. It strives to make the process of learning to program as visual and entertaining as possible. The content is based on my extensive experience teaching first-time coders, designers, and interactive media students. The skills and knowledge you’ll gain are fundamental to programming for an ever-expanding horizon of creative technologies, such as games, the web, augmented/virtual reality, and even visual effects for films.</p>
			<p>If you’re an artist, student, designer, researcher, or just somebody keen on picking up coding skills, Python Mode for Processing is excellent for learning to program in a visual context.</p>
			<p>For anybody with prior programming experience, this book would be useful for learning Python, Python Mode for Processing, or creative coding techniques.</p>
			<p>
				You may have experience with another <em>visual</em> programming language—something like Scratch, where you connect together graphical elements like boxes, icons, and arrows. Python is not such a language—rather, it is a <em>textual</em> programming language that requires you to type code. To make learning visual, though, you’ll focus on writing code that produces drawings, patterns, animations, data visualizations, user interfaces, and simulations. This approach not only makes for cool-looking graphics, but also helps you visualize the underlying concepts of programming.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-500969f05-0002">What Is Python Mode for Processing?</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Python Mode for Processing</em> combines the <em>Python</em> programming language and <em>Processing</em>, a development environment for interactive and graphics programming. You’ll also see Python Mode for Processing referred to as <em>Processing.py</em>. The project started as a command line tool named Processing.py, but its developer decided to label it Python Mode when it was made available for the Processing development environment. In this book, you can consider the terms largely interchangeable.</p>
			<p>
				Python is one of the most popular programming languages in use today. There are many good reasons for this, but here’s why <em>you</em> should care. First, Python is a beginner-friendly language. It’s more approachable than languages like Java or C++, so you’ll find it easier to read, write, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xvii" title="xvii"/>understand. Second, it’s a general-purpose language, suitable for programming artificial intelligence (AI), games, simulations, web applications, and just about everything in between.</p>
			<p>Processing, which has been around since the early 2000s, is composed of a programming language and an editor for writing and compiling code. It provides a collection of special commands that allow you to draw, animate, and handle user input by using code. The creators, Casey Reas and Ben Fry, developed Processing to make programming more accessible for designers and artists, although its thriving user base has grown to include researchers, hobbyists, and educators.</p>
			<p>
				Java is the basis for the original Processing programming language, but other variants have since appeared, including JavaScript (<em>p5.js</em>) and Ruby (<em>JRubyArt</em>) versions. In 2010, Jonathan Feinberg created Processing.py, which you can think of as a sort of extension for Processing that allows you to write Python instead of Java-esque code.</p>
			<p>Both Python and Processing are open source and won’t cost you a cent. What’s more, you can use them on just about any platform, including Linux, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-500969f05-0003">What Are Algorithms?</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">You’ll encounter the term <em>algorithm </em>frequently in the domain of programming. You can think of an algorithm as a set of rules a computer or machine must follow to achieve a particular goal. As an example, an algorithm for making a cup of instant coffee would read as follows:</p>
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li value="1">Place one teaspoon of coffee granules in a mug.</li>
				<li value="2">Fill the kettle with water.</li>
				<li value="3">Switch on the kettle.</li>
				<li value="4">Once the water has boiled, add 240 ml boiling water to the mug.</li>
				<li value="5">Add one level teaspoon of sugar to the same mug.</li>
				<li value="6">Stir the contents.</li>
				<li value="7">Serve.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>However, this set of steps is insufficient for programming a real-life coffee-making robot. Should the sizes of the mugs vary, smaller ones would overflow. Furthermore, the robot would ignore any requests for milk or extra sugar. Computers cannot make any assumptions, and require explicit and unambiguous direction, communicated in a language that machines understand—like Python. Learning the Python language may be the hurdle you face initially, but as you grow more fluent, the challenge will shift toward the mastery of algorithmic thinking.</p>

			<p class="BodyFirst"><em>Creative coding</em> is computer programming for creative output. This broad term encompasses, but is not limited to, computer-generated audio and visual art, interactive installations, experimental games, and data visualizations.</p>
			<p>
				Take, for example, Frederic Brodbeck’s <em>Cinemetrics</em> project. Using Python, Brodbeck developed a program that analyzes DVD movie data to generate visual <em>fingerprints</em> of films. The fingerprint is an open ring formed from many segments; a single segment represents a span of 10 shots, and the concentric bands show the color breakdown for each of those segments. The diagonal length of each segment indicates the amount of motion. Figure 1 is a <em>Cinemetrics</em> fingerprint for the film <em>Quantum of Solace</em> (2008).</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The fingerprints can also be animated, in which case motion is instead visualized using pulsating segments. An interactive interface provides a selection of presets and filters so that you can arrange fingerprints alongside one another and make comparisons—for example, between originals and remakes, different genres, the works of a single director, and so forth. Figure 2 compares (from left to right) <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (1968), <em>The Simpsons Movie</em> (2007), and a soccer match.</p>

			<p>Many creative coding projects employ a similar underlying approach, in which data is fed into a program to influence how it controls output. Music visualizations with real-time audio synchronization—like those featured in popular media player software—are a good example. However, you can experiment with plenty of other data sources, such as web feeds, fitness trackers, environmental sensors, and a plethora of public datasets.</p>
			<p>In some instances, it’s useful to opt for randomized data values. Consider procedurally generated game content. As opposed to constructing levels manually, you can program games to generate dungeon layouts, terrain, narrative elements, and enemy spawn locations automatically. Of course, such games should include sensible constraints; for instance, a cap on the total number of enemies that can appear at once, and algorithms for ensuring that stage layouts are not impossible to traverse.</p>
			<p>
				Game characters may be composed using a random selection of modular components, or generated entirely from shapes and formulas. As an example, I’ve written a Processing Python program that generates the randomized microbial beasties displayed in Figure 3. The code—an adaptation of Lieven Menschaert’s NodeBox script <em>Aquatics!</em>—spawns a creature with a random fill color, shape (defined by something named the <em>superformula</em>), and no fewer than three eyes. There’s a 70 percent chance that hair will grow along the creature’s edges, which can be swayed by the force of a randomly directed current.</p>

				Countless examples of cool, creative coding projects exist—from robots that doodle and write poetry, to evolutionary simulators, and even a program that pores over satellite imagery in search of architecture or infrastructure that resembles letters (<em>The Aerial Bold Project</em> by Benedikt Groß and Joey Lee, 2016).</p>
			<p>Perhaps this creative coding thing sounds a bit too artsy for you? Processing also isn’t ideal for that race car sim you’ve always dreamed of building, and it’s definitely no good for backend web development. That’s okay. Creative coding with Processing’s Python Mode need not be the ultimate goal of reading this book. Think of it as a starting point for exploring Python, other frameworks, creative applications for coding, and programming in general.</p>
			<h2 id="h1-500969f05-0005">Where Can I Find Help?</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">Programming is rewarding, in part because it’s challenging. If you find yourself struggling with something, do not stress; that’s normal! With a little perseverance, you’ll soon grasp whatever has you snagged.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-500969f05-0001"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxi" title="xxi"/>Online Resources</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">If you’re getting nowhere, reach out to online communities. You’ll find a dedicated category for Processing.py in the official Processing forum at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://discourse.processing.org/">https://discourse.processing.org/</a>. You’ll often discover that somebody has already encountered and received a solution for the challenge you’re facing; if not, go ahead and create a new topic. Incidentally, the author of this book is known to lurk about in this friendly and welcoming corner of the internet.</p>
			<p>
				The official Python Mode reference is available at <em>https://py.processing.org/reference/</em>. Each entry includes a description and brief code example. It’s handy to keep this web page open while you work in the Processing development environment.</p>
			<h3 id="h2-500969f05-0002">Source Code and Solutions</h3>
			<p class="BodyFirst">You’ll be typing a lot of code. This is a good thing because the best way to learn is by doing. At times, however, you might mistype something or be unable to figure why your code refuses to work. In such instances, it can be helpful to have access to a complete, working version of the file. You can access all of the code in this book, as well as solutions to the challenges in each chapter, at <a class="LinkURL" href="https://github.com/tabreturn/processing.py-book/">https://github.com/tabreturn/processing.py-book/</a>.

			<h2 id="h1-500969f05-0006">What’s in This Book?</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">This book begins with the basics and builds up toward more advanced topics as you progress. Each chapter, therefore, requires a grasp of the concepts introduced in the chapters preceding it. You’ll be working, step by step, through a series of practical tasks. You’ll also find some theory, plenty of visuals, and challenges to consolidate what you’ve learned.</p>
			<p>The following outline provides a brief overview of the contents in each chapter:</p>
			<ol class="none">
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 1: Hello, World!</span>  This chapter covers the installation and setup procedure for the book and introduces the basics of drawing with code. You’ll also learn how computers manage color, how you can store and reuse values (using variables), and how to perform basic arithmetic operations using Python.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 2: Drawing More Complicated Shapes</span>  Having covered some drawing essentials in the first chapter, you’ll move on to drawing more organic shapes, as opposed to geometric ones. You’ll learn to define shapes by using points (or vertices) and curves, which enable you to draw just about any shape with code.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 3: Introduction to Strings and Working with Text</span>  In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use Python’s string features to manipulate text. You’ll also learn how to use Processing functions to draw text to the display window, in different styles and colors, and in different fonts.</li>
				<li><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="Page_xxii" title="xxii"/><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 4: Conditional Statements</span>  This is where you really begin to think like a programmer. In this chapter, you’ll introduce control flow to your programs. In other words, you’ll learn how to write programs that can make decisions, executing different actions to respond to different situations.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 5: Iteration and Randomness</span>  In this chapter, you’ll learn how to write programs that can repeat an operation a specified number of times or until a certain requirement is met. Toward the end of the chapter, you’ll experiment with randomness and creating tiled patterns.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 6: Motion and Transformation</span>  This chapter focuses primarily on adding motion to your Processing programs and transforming the drawing space. You’ll also learn how to save frames as images and how to get time values from your computer. You’ll use these skills to create an animated screensaver and analog clock.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 7: Working with Lists and Reading Data</span>  Python lists will unlock powerful ways to manage and manipulate values in collections. You’ll explore techniques for data visualization. You’ll also learn to read in list data from external files. For the final task, you’ll render a chart by using a CSV file.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 8: Dictionaries and JSON</span>  Dictionaries are similar to lists in that they store collections of items. With dictionaries, however, you access items by using a key (usually a word) instead of referring to the item position. Once again, you’ll get to use your new dictionary skills for data visualization. You’ll also learn to work with JSON data.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 9: Functions and Periodic Motion</span>  You’ll use functions to divide a program into named sections of reusable code. This will make your code more modular, and easier to read and modify. You’ll also delve into some trigonometry for generating elliptical and wave-type motions.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 10: Object-Oriented Programming and PVector</span>  You can use object-oriented programming to structure programs by modeling real-world objects. In this chapter, you’ll employ an object-oriented approach to building an amoeba simulation. You’ll also learn to program the amoebas’ motion by using Processing’s <code>PVector</code> class.</li>
				<li><span class="RunInHead">Chapter 11: Mouse and Keyboard Interaction</span>  In this chapter, you’ll add interactivity to your programs. Processing can handle input from various devices, but here you’ll focus on mouse and keyboard input to build a paint app. In the process, you’ll learn about event functions and how to control Processing’s draw loop behavior.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="h1-500969f05-0007">Let’s Go!</h2>
			<p class="BodyFirst">The speed at which you progress through these chapters is likely to be influenced by your prior experience in similar areas. If you’ve done any type of programming before, Python or otherwise, you’ll encounter some familiar concepts. That said, it’s not a race! Enjoy the ride, stop for breaks, and if you’re feeling really inspired, feel free to head off-road.</p>
