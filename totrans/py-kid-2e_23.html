<p class="indent">In this appendix, you’ll find information on how to fix some less common problems with Python. If you happen to be running older versions of some operating systems, you may experience these issues.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app03lev1sec1">“TK” Errors Importing Turtle on Ubuntu</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you’re using an older version of Ubuntu Linux and get errors when you import turtle, you might need to install a piece of software called <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_324"/><em>tkinter</em>. To do so, open the Ubuntu Software Center and enter <strong>python-tk</strong> in the search box. “Tkinter—Writing Tk Applications with Python” should appear in the window. Click <strong>Install</strong> to install this package. This shouldn’t be required if you’re running a more recent version of Ubuntu—if possible, you should get the owner of your computer to update it for you.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app03lev1sec2">Attribute Error Using Turtle</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Some new programmers experience strange <em>attribute</em> errors when trying to use turtle:</p>&#13;
 <pre class="pre1"><span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="orange">import</span> turtle&#13;
<span class="brown">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> t = turtle.Turtle()&#13;
<span class="red">Traceback (most recent call last):&#13;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;&#13;
AttributeError: module 'turtle' has no attribute 'Turtle'</span>&#13;
</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The most typical cause of this error is when you have created a file called <em>turtle.py</em> in your home folder. In this case, when you enter <span class="literal">import turtle</span>, you’re getting the file you created and not Python’s <span class="literal">turtle</span> module. If you delete or rename that file, the correct module should import correctly.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app03lev1sec3">Problems Running Turtle</h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you have problems when using the <span class="literal">turtle</span> module, and the turtle window itself doesn’t appear to be working, try using the Python console instead of the Python Shell, as follows:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li class="bull">In Windows, enter <strong>Python</strong> in the search box and click <strong>Python  3.1<em>x</em></strong> in the Apps list. You can use the Windows command prompt instead (click the Windows icon and type <strong>cmd</strong> in the search box). When that opens, you’ll need to enter the path to a program called <em>python.exe</em>. If you’ve installed Python 3.10, the path might be something like this: <em>AppData\Local\Programs\Python \Python310\python.exe</em>. However, it very much depends on what version of Python you’ve installed, so this method should probably be the last resort (you can see the result of running this in <a href="app03.xhtml#app03fig01">Figure C-1</a>).&#13;

<p class="figcap"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_325"/><em>Figure C-1: Running the Python console from Windows command prompt</em></p></li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">In macOS, click the Spotlight Search icon at the top-right corner of the screen (it should look like a magnifying glass) and enter <strong>Terminal</strong> in the input box. Then enter <span class="codestrong">python3</span> when the terminal opens.</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">In Ubuntu Linux, open the terminal from your <strong>Show Applications</strong> menu and enter <span class="codestrong">python3.10</span> (note that your version number may be different).</li>&#13;
<li class="noindent">In Raspberry Pi, click the Terminal icon on the menu bar at the top, or click <strong>Terminal</strong> in the <strong>Accessories</strong> menu and enter <span class="codestrong">/usr/local/opt/python-3.10.0</span> (this will work only if you followed the Raspberry Pi installation instructions in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapter 1</a>; note that your version number may be different).</li></ul>&#13;
<p class="indent">The Python console is similar to the Python Shell (IDLE), but it doesn’t have syntax highlighting (colored text), easy save options, and other beneficial features. However, if you’re having problems running turtle in the Python Shell, using the Python console might help.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="app03lev1sec4">Class Takes No Arguments</h3>&#13;
<p class="indent">A common error some readers hit is a <span class="literal">TypeError</span>, usually first seen in <a href="ch11.xhtml#ch11">Chapter 11</a>. You might see an error similar to the following:</p>&#13;
 <pre class="pre1">b = Ball(canvas, <span class="green">'red'</span>)&#13;
<span class="red">Traceback (most recent call last):&#13;
  File "/usr/lib/python3.10/idlelib/run.py", line 573, in runcode&#13;
    exec(code, self.locals)&#13;
  File "&lt;pyshell#4&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_326"/>TypeError: Ball() takes no arguments</span>&#13;
</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">The reason for this is generally missing underscores. The <span class="literal">Ball</span> class is first defined like this:</p>&#13;
 <pre class="pre1"><span class="orange">class</span> Ball:&#13;
    <span class="orange">def</span> __init__(self, canvas, color):&#13;
        self.canvas = canvas&#13;
        self.id = canvas.create_oval(10, 10, 25, 25, fill=color)&#13;
        self.canvas.move(self.id, 245, 100)&#13;
</pre>&#13;
<p class="indent">However, if you mistype the <span class="literal">__init__</span> function with a single underscore on either side (<span class="literal">_init_</span>), Python will no longer recognize it as an initialization function. This is why calling <span class="literal">Ball(...)</span> with any arguments results in an error—Python thinks there is no initialization function to call (in fact, it creates a default initialization function for you that has no parameters).</p>&#13;
