    patterns in word sequences using spaCy. To understand sentence analysis and patterns,
    you need some basic knowledge of linguistics. This appendix contains a linguistic
    primer to use as a reference.

    more commonly used in linguistics. This section explains the difference between
    these two grammar types. If you have a formal linguistic background, you may find

- en: Also known as a constituent-based grammar, a *phrase structure grammar* models
    natural language based on how words combine to form constituents in a sentence.
    In syntax, a *constituent* is a group of words that functions as a single unit
    in a sentence. The phrase structure rules decompose a sentence into its constituent
    parts, forming a tree structure that begins with individual words and builds up
    larger and larger constituents.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In contrast, a *dependency grammar* is a word-based grammar that focuses on
    the relations between individual words rather than between constituents. As a
    result, a dependency parse, like the ones shown throughout this book, forms a
    tree that reflects how words relate to other words in a sentence.

- en: The phrase structure tree breaks up the sentence based on the fact that the
    sentence consists of a noun phrase and a verb phrase. Those phrases appear on
    the second level of the hierarchy, directly under the sentence (S) mark—the formal
    top level. On the bottom level are the individual words that make up those phrases.

- en: In contrast, the dependency structure uses the verb as the structural center
    of a sentence. The other words are either directly or indirectly connected to
    this verb with the help of directed links, known as *dependencies*. The dependency
    grammar that spaCy uses by default expresses the grammatical structure of a sentence
    as a set of one-to-one correspondences between words.

- en: Each of these relations represents a grammatical function in which one word
    is the *child*, or the dependent word, and the other is the *head*, or the governor.
    For example, in the pair “blue sky,” the dominant word is “sky,” and “blue”—its
    modifier—is its subordinate. You can think of the head as the word with the most
    relative “importance” and without which the child doesn’t make sense. By contrast,
    the head of a relation can often stand in a sentence without the child (for example,
    you don’t need “African” or “wild” in the sentence shown in [Figure A-1](../Text/app01.xhtml#app01fig01),
    nor “quickly”).

- en: Each word in a sentence must be connected to exactly one head. But the same
    word might have none, one, or several children. The spaCy grammar assumes that
    the head of a sentence (the `ROOT` token) is its own head. In this example, the
    verb “run” is the head of the sentence, so the `head` property of the Token object
    representing this word will refer to this same Token object.

  zh: 句子中的每个单词必须连接到恰好一个主词。但同一个单词可能没有子节点、一个子节点或多个子节点。spaCy 语法假设句子的主词（`ROOT` 词性）是它自己的主词。在这个例子中，动词“run”是句子的主词，因此表示该词的
    Token 对象的 `head` 属性将指向同一个 Token 对象。

- en: A *direct object* is a noun (or a noun phrase) denoting something that is directly
    acted on by a verb. A *transitive verb* accepts a direct object. In most cases,
    for identifying intent, the transitive verb and its direct object are the most
    important words in a sentence to extract. The reason is that these words typically
    best describe the action and the thing acted upon. For example, in the sentence,
    “I want a pizza,” the words “want” and “pizza” express the sentence’s intent.

    such as “in,” “above,” “under,” “after,” and “before” express spatial or temporal
    relations. Others, such as “to,” “of,” and “for,” indicate semantic roles. For
    instance, in the sentence, “You’ll find the envelope under the book,” the preposition
    “under” expresses a spatial relationship between the envelope and the book. And
    in the sentence, “I will deploy it to a channel,” the use of the preposition “to”
    indicates the role goal expressed by the prepositional phrase “a channel.”
