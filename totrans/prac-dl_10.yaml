    [Chapter 5](ch05.xhtml#ch05). Recall that this dataset consists of 28×28 pixel
    8-bit grayscale images of handwritten digits, [0,9]. In vector form, each 28 ×
    28 image is unraveled into a vector of 28 × 28 = 784 elements, all bytes ([0,255]).
    The unraveling lays each row end to end. Therefore, each sample has 784 elements
    and an associated label. The training set has 60,000 samples, while the test set
    has 10,000\. For our experiments, we won’t use all of the data in the training
    set. This is to help illustrate the effect of network parameters and to keep our
    training times reasonable. Refer back to [Figure 5-3](ch05.xhtml#ch5fig3) for
    representative MNIST digits.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The hidden layer sizes are given as a tuple, where each element is the number
    of nodes in the corresponding layer. Recall that sklearn works with only fully
    connected layers, so a single number is all we need to specify the size. The input
    samples given for training determine the size of the input layer. Here the input
    samples are vectors representing the digit images, so there are 28 × 28 = 784
    nodes in the input layer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What about the output layer? It’s not specified explicitly because it depends
    on the number of classes in the training labels. The MNIST dataset has 10 classes,
    so there will be 10 nodes in the output layer. When the `predict_proba` method
    is called to get an output probability, sklearn applies a softmax over the 10
    outputs. If the model is binary, meaning the only class labels are 0 and 1, then
    there is only one output node, a logistic (sigmoid), representing the probability
    of belonging to class 1.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let’s look at the parameters we passed in to `MLPClassifier`. First, we
    explicitly state that we want to use the SGD solver. The solver is the approach
    used to modify the weights and biases during training. All the solvers use backprop
    to calculate the gradients; how we use those gradients varies. Plain vanilla SGD
    is good enough for us right now.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Next, we set a low tolerance so that we’ll train the requested number of epochs
    (`max_iter`). We also turn off Nesterov momentum (a variant of standard momentum)
    and early stopping (generally useful but not desired here).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The initial learning rate is set to the default value of 0.001, as is the value
    of standard momentum, 0.9\. The number of epochs is arbitrarily set to 200 (the
    default), but we’ll explore this more in the experiments that follow. Please indulge
    your curiosity at all times and see what changing these values does to things.
    For consistency’s sake, we’ll use these values as defaults throughout unless they
    are the parameters we want to experiment with.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other helper function in [Listing 10-1](ch10.xhtml#ch10lis1) is `run`. This
    function will train and test the classifier object it’s passed using the standard
    sklearn `fit` and `score` methods. It also does some other things that we have
    not seen before.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In particular, after timing how long training takes, we extract the final training
    loss value, the network weights, and the network biases from the `MLPClassifier`
    object so that we can return them. The `MLPClassifier` class minimizes the log-loss,
    which we described in [Chapter 9](ch09.xhtml#ch09). We store the log-loss in the
    `loss_` member variable. The size of this value, and how it changes during training,
    gives us a clue as to how well the network is learning. In general, the smaller
    the log-loss, the better the network is doing. As you explore neural networks
    more and more, you’ll begin to develop intuition for what a good loss value is
    and whether the training process is learning quickly or not by how rapidly the
    loss changes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The weights and biases are stored in the `coefs_` and `intercepts_` member variables.
    These are lists of NumPy matrices (weights) and vectors (biases), respectively.
    Here we use them to calculate the number of parameters in the network by summing
    the number of elements in each matrix and vector. This is what the two small loops
    in the `run` function do. Finally, we return all this information, including the
    score against the test set, to the `main` function. The `main` function is shown
    in [Listing 10-2](ch10.xhtml#ch10lis2).

    results for the logistic activation function show improved scores as the single
    hidden layer gets larger, something we might expect to see, but when we move to
    more than one hidden layer, the network fails to train. We know that it was unable
    to train because the scores on the test set are abysmal. If you check the output,
    you’ll see that the loss values do not go down. If the loss value does not decrease
    while training proceeds, something is wrong.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It’s not immediately evident why training failed for the logistic activation
    function case. One possibility is a bug in sklearn, but this is rather unlikely
    given how widely used the toolkit is. The most likely culprit has to do with network
    initialization. The sklearn toolkit uses the standard, commonly used initialization
    schemes we discussed in [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08). But these are tailored for
    ReLU and tanh activation functions and may not be performing well for the logistic
    case.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For our purposes, we can view this failure as a glaring sign that the logistic
    activation function is not a good one to use for the hidden layers. Sadly, this
    is precisely the activation function that was widely used throughout much of the
    early history of neural networks, so we were shooting ourselves in the foot from
    the beginning. No wonder it took so long for neural networks to finally find their
    proper place! From here on out, we’ll ignore the logistic activation function
    results.

    in each case, the ReLU activation function slightly outperforms tanh for the same
    number of nodes in the hidden layer, though these differences are likely not statistically
    significant with only 10 models per architecture. Still, it follows a general
    observation prevalent in the community: ReLU is preferred to tanh.'

    that adding a second and even third hidden layer continues to improve the test
    scores but with diminishing returns. This is also a widely experienced phenomenon
    that we should look at a little more closely. In particular, we should consider
    the number of parameters in the models of [Table 10-2](ch10.xhtml#ch10tab2). This
    makes the comparison a bit unfair. If, instead, we train models that have closely
    matched numbers of parameters, then we can more fairly compare the performance
    of the models. Any differences in performance we see can be plausibly attributed
    to the number of layers used since the overall number of parameters will be virtually
    the same.

    We first picked the single-layer sizes we wanted to test. We then determined the
    number of parameters in models with those architectures. Next, we crafted two-layer
    architectures using the rules of thumb from [Chapter 8](ch08.xhtml#ch08) so that
    the number of parameters in those models will be close to the corresponding number
    of parameters in the single-layer models. Finally, we repeated the process for
    three-layer models. Doing things this way lets us compare the performance of the
    models for very similar numbers of parameters. In essence, we’re fixing the number
    of parameters in the model and altering only the way they interact with each other.

    rate increases. For the squares, however, the performance remains high and constant
    regardless of the base learning rate. For the circles, we trained for 50 epochs,
    always. This is a more significant number of epochs than were used for the squares
    plot for the corresponding base learning rates. This means that in the circles’
    case, we stomped around quite a bit after we got near the center of the field.
    For the case of the squares, however, we limited the number of epochs, so we stopped
    walking when we were near the center of the field, hence the improved performance.
    This implies that we need to adjust the number of epochs (gradient descent steps
    taken) to match the learning rate so that we get near to the minimum of the loss
    function quickly, without a lot of stomping around, but not so quickly that we
    are taking large steps that won’t let us converge on the minimum.

    Because of space considerations, we can’t fully explore the effect of changing
    the learning rate during training. Still, we can at least use our football field
    thought experiment to help us visualize why changing the learning rate during
    training makes sense. Recall, the network is initialized intelligently but randomly.
    This means we start somewhere on the field at random. The odds are low that this
    arbitrary position is near the center, the minimum of the error surface, so we
    do need to apply gradient descent to move us closer to the center. At first, we
    might as well take significant steps to move quickly through the field. Since
    we are following the gradient, this moves us toward the center. If we keep taking
    large steps, however, we might overshoot the center. After taking a few large
    steps, we might think it wise to start taking smaller steps, believing that we
    are now closer to our goal of reaching the center. The more we walk, the smaller
    our steps so we can get as close to the center as possible. This is why the learning
    rate is typically reduced during training.

    `score` after each epoch of training. Calling `score` gives us the accuracy on

    nonzero value for *α* produces a lower test error compared to not using L2 regularization
    at all. We can conclude that L2 regularization is helpful. The different *α* values
    all result in approximately the same test error, but larger values are slightly
    more effective and reach a lower test error sooner. Compare *α* = 0.1 to *α* =
    0.4, for example.

    about the total loss minimized during training. When *α* is large, we’re placing
    more importance on the L2 term relative to the network’s error over the minibatch.
    This means that when we ask the network to adjust the weights and biases during
    backprop, it’ll be more strongly affected by the magnitude of the parameters of
    the network than the training data itself. Because the network is focusing less
    on reducing the loss due to the training data, we might expect the per epoch test
    error to vary more.'

    set error from about 7.5 percent to about 6 percent. Momentum helps and should
    be used, especially with values near the standard of 0.9\. In practice, people

    This increase is a telltale sign of overfitting: as we keep training, the model
    stops learning general features of the parent distribution and starts to focus
    on specific features of the training set. We didn’t plot the training set error,
    but it would be going down even as the test set error starts to rise. The lowest
    test set error is at about 1,200 epochs. Ideally, this would be where we stop
