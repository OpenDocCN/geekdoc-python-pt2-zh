<p class="noindents">Programming involves writing code to solve a problem. As such, I want to solve problems with you from the outset. That is, rather than learning Python concept by concept and then solving a problem, we’re going to use a problem to dictate the concepts we need to learn.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">In this chapter, we’ll solve two problems: determining the number of words in a line (like the word-count feature in a word processor) and calculating the volume of a cone. Solving these problems requires a tour of quite a few Python concepts. You may feel that you need more details to fully understand some of what I introduce here and how it all fits together in the design of a Python program. Don’t worry: we’ll revisit and elaborate on the most important concepts in later chapters.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec1">What We’ll Be Doing</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">As described in the introduction, we’ll be solving competitive programming problems using the Python programming language. The competitive programming problems can each be found on an online judge website. I assume that you’ve followed the instructions in the introduction to install Python and make your judge accounts.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_2"/>For each problem, we’ll write a program to solve it. Each problem specifies the kind of <em>input</em> that our program will be provided, and the kind of <em>output</em> (or result) that is expected. Our program correctly solves the problem if it can take any valid input and produce the correct output.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">In general, there will be millions or billions of possible inputs. Each such input is referred to as a <em>problem instance</em>. For example, in the first problem that we’ll solve, the input is a line of text, like <span class="literal">hello there</span> or <span class="literal">bbaabbb aa abab</span>. Our task will be to output the number of words in the line. One of the most powerful ideas in programming is that often a small amount of general-purpose code can solve a seemingly endless number of problem instances. Whether the line has 2 words or 3 or 50, it won’t matter. Our program will get it right every time.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indentb">Our programs will perform three tasks:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="uln-indent"><strong>Read input</strong> We need to determine the specific instance of the problem that we’re solving, so we first read the provided input.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="uln-indent"><strong>Process</strong> We process the input to determine the correct output.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="uln-indent"><strong>Write output</strong> Having solved the problem, we produce the desired output.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indenta">The boundaries between these steps may not always be crisp—we might have to interleave some processing with producing some output, for example—but it will be helpful to keep these three broad steps in mind.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">You likely use programs on a daily basis that follow this input-process-output model. Consider a calculator program: you type in a formula (the input), the program crunches your numbers (process), and the program displays the answer (output). Or consider a web search engine: you type in a search query (input), the search engine determines the most relevant results (process), and it displays them (output).</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Contrast these kinds of programs with <em>interactive</em> programs, which fuse input, processing, and output. For example, I’m typing this book using a text editor. When I type a character, the editor responds by adding that character to my document. It doesn’t wait for me to type the entire document before displaying it to me; it interactively displays it as I build it. We won’t be writing interactive programs in this book. If you’re interested in writing such programs after studying this book, you’ll be happy to hear that Python is certainly up for the task.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The text for each problem is found both here and on the online judge. However, the text won’t match, because I’ve rewritten it for purposes of consistency throughout the book. Don’t worry: what I’ve written conveys the same information as the official problem statement.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec2">The Python Shell</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">For each problem in the book, we want to write a program and save it in a file. But that assumes we know what program to write! For many of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_3"/>problems in the book, we’ll need to learn some new Python features before we can solve the problem.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The best way to experiment with Python features is by using the Python shell. It’s an interactive environment where you type some Python code and press ENTER, and Python shows you the result. Once we learn enough to solve the current problem, we’ll stop using the shell and start typing our solution in a text file instead.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">To begin, create a new folder on your desktop called <em>programming</em>. We’ll use that folder to store all of the work that we do for this book.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Now, we’ll navigate to this <em>programming</em> folder and launch the Python shell. Follow these steps for your operating system whenever you’d like to start the Python shell.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec1">Windows</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">On Windows, do the following:</p>&#13;&#13;
<ol>&#13;&#13;
<li class="noindentt">Hold down SHIFT and right-click your <strong>programming</strong> folder.</li>&#13;&#13;
<li class="noindentt">From the resulting menu, click <strong>Open PowerShell window here</strong>. If that choice isn’t there, click <strong>Open command window here</strong>.</li>&#13;&#13;
<li class="noindentt">At the bottom of the resulting window, you’ll see a line that ends with a greater-than sign (<span class="literal">&gt;</span>). This is your operating system <em>prompt</em>, and it’s waiting for you to type a command. You type operating system commands here, <em>not</em> Python code. Be sure to press ENTER after each command.</li>&#13;&#13;
<li class="noindentt">You’re now in your <em>programming</em> folder. You can type <span class="codestrong">dir</span> (for <em>directory</em>) if you’d like to see what’s there. You shouldn’t see any files yet, because we haven’t created any.</li>&#13;&#13;
<li class="noindentt">Now, enter <span class="codestrong">python</span> to start the Python shell.</li>&#13;&#13;
</ol>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">When you start the Python shell, you should see something like this:</p>&#13;&#13;

<h3 class="h3a" id="ch01lev1sec3"><span class="h3aa">Problem #1: Word Count</span></h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Now it’s time for our first problem! We’re going to use Python to write a little word-count program. We’ll learn how to read input from the user, process the input to solve the problem, and output the result. We’ll also learn how to manipulate text and numbers in our programs, make use of built-in Python operations, and store intermediate results on our way to the solution.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">This is DMOJ problem <span class="literal">dmopc15c7p2</span>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec4">The Challenge</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Count the number of words provided. For this problem, a <em>word</em> is any sequence of lowercase letters. For example, <span class="literal">hello</span> is a word, but so are non-English “words” like <span class="literal">bbaabbb</span>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec5">Input</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">The input is one line of text, consisting of lowercase letters and spaces. There is exactly one space between each pair of words, and there are no spaces before the first word or after the last word.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The maximum length of the line is 80 characters.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec6">Output</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Output the number of words in the input line.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec4"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_6"/>Strings</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent"><em>Values</em> are a fundamental building block of Python programs. Each value has a <em>type</em>, and the type determines the operations that can be performed on the value. In the Word Count problem, we’re working with a line of text. Text is stored as a string value in Python, so we’ll need to learn about strings. To solve the problem, we output the number of words in the text, so we also need to learn about numeric values. Let’s begin with strings.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec7">Representing Strings</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>string</em> is the Python type that’s used to store and manipulate text. To write a string value, we place its characters between single quotes. Follow along in the Python shell:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'hello'</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'hello'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'a bunch of words'</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'a bunch of words'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The Python shell echoes each string that I’ve typed.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">What happens when our string contains a single quote as one of its characters?</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'don't say that'</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1<br/>&#13;&#13;
    'don't say that'<br/>&#13;&#13;
         ^<br/>&#13;&#13;
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The single quote in the word <span class="literal">don't</span> terminates the string. The rest of the line, <span class="literal">t say that'</span>, therefore doesn’t make sense, and that’s what generates the syntax error. A <em>syntax error</em> means that we have violated the rules of Python and have not written valid Python code.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">To fix this, we can take advantage of the fact that double quotes can also be used to delimit strings:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">"don't say that"</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
"don't say that"</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Unless the string in question has a single quote, I won’t use double quotes in this book.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec8"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_7"/>String Operators</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">We can use a string to hold the text whose words we want to count. To count the words—or to do anything else with strings—we need to learn how to work with strings.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Strings come with a rich variety of operations that we can perform. Some of them use special symbols between their operands. For example, the <span class="literal">+</span> operator is used for string concatenation:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'hello' + 'there'</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'hellothere'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Oops—we need a space between those two words. Let’s add one to the end of the first string:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'hello ' + 'there'</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'hello there'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">There’s also the <span class="literal">*</span> operator, which replicates a string a specified number of times:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'-' * 30</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'------------------------------'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">That <span class="literal">30</span> there is an integer value. I’ll have more to say about integers shortly.</p>&#13;&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;&#13;
<p class="sb-title"><strong>CONCEPT CHECK</strong></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="sidebarp">What is the output of the following code?</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'' * 3</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="alphat">A. <span class="literal">''''''</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="alpha">B. <span class="literal">''</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="alpha">C. This code produces a syntax error (invalid Python code)</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="sb-noindent1">Answer: B. <span class="literal">''</span> is the empty string—a string of zero characters. Repeating an empty string three times is still an empty string!</p>&#13;&#13;
</div>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec9"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_8"/>String Methods</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>method</em> is an operation specific to a type of value. Strings have a large number of methods. For example, there’s a method called <span class="literal">upper</span>, which produces the uppercase version of a string:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'hello'.upper()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'HELLO'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The information we get back from a method is known as the method’s <em>return value</em>. For example, we could say for the previous example that <span class="literal">upper</span> returned the string <span class="literal">'HELLO'</span>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Performing a method on a value is known as <em>calling</em> the method. Calling a method involves placing the <em>dot operator</em> (<span class="literal">.</span>) between the value and the method name. It also requires parentheses after the method name. For some methods, we leave those parentheses empty, as when calling <span class="literal">upper</span>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">For other methods, we can optionally include information there. Still other methods require information and won’t work at all without it. Information we include when calling a method is referred to as the method’s <em>arguments</em>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">For example, strings have a <span class="literal">strip</span> method. If called with no arguments, <span class="literal">strip</span> removes all leading and trailing spaces from a string:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'   abc'.strip()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'abc'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'   abc       '.strip()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'abc'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'abc'.strip()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'abc'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">But we can also call it with a string as the argument. If we do, that argument determines which characters are stripped from the beginning and the end:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'abc'.strip('a')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'bc'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'abca'.strip('a')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'bc'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'abca'.strip('ac')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'b'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s talk about one more string method: <span class="literal">count</span>. We pass it a string argument, and it tells us how many occurrences of that argument are found in our string:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'abc'.count('a')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
1<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'abc'.count('q')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
0<br/>&#13;&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_9"/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'aaabcaa'.count('a')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
5<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'aaabcaa'.count('ab')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
1</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">If occurrences of the argument overlap, only the first counts:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'ababa'.count('aba')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
1</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Unlike the other methods I’ve described, <span class="literal">count</span> is directly useful to our Word Count problem.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Think of a string like <span class="literal">'this is a string with a few words'</span>. Notice that a space comes after each word. In fact, if you had to count the number of words by hand, you might use the spaces to tell you where each word ends. What if we count the number of spaces in a string? To do that, we can pass a string consisting of a single space character to <span class="literal">count</span>. It looks like this:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'this is a string with a few words'.count(' ')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
7</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">We get a value of <span class="literal">7</span>. That’s not quite the number of words—the string has eight words—but we’re close. Why are we getting <span class="literal">7</span> instead of <span class="literal">8</span>?</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The reason is that each word has a space after it except the last word. Counting the spaces therefore fails to account for the final word. To remedy that, we need to learn how to handle numbers.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec5">Integer and Floating-Point Numbers</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">An <em>expression</em> is made up of values and operators. We’ll now see how to write numeric values and combine them with operators.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">There are two different Python types that represent numbers: integers (with no decimal part) and floating-point numbers (with a decimal part).</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">We write integer values as numbers with no decimal point. Here are some examples:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">30</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
30<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">7</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
7<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">1000000</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
1000000<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">-9</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
-9</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">A value on its own is the simplest kind of expression.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The familiar mathematical operators work on integers. We have <span class="literal">+</span> for addition, <span class="literal">-</span> for subtraction, and <span class="literal">*</span> for multiplication. We can use these operators to write more complicated expressions.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_10"/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">8 + 10</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
18<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">8 - 10</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
-2<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">8 * 10</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
80</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice the spaces around the operators. While <span class="literal">8+10</span> and <span class="literal">8 + 10</span> are the same as far as Python is concerned, the latter makes the expression easier for us humans to read.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Python has two division operators, not one! The <span class="literal">//</span> operator performs integer division, which throws away any remainder and rounds the result down:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">8 // 2</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
4<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">9 // 5</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
1<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">-9 // 5</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
-2</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">If you want the remainder of the division, use the mod operator, written as <span class="literal">%</span>. For example, dividing 8 by 2 leaves no remainder:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">8 % 2</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
0</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Dividing 8 by 3 leaves a remainder of 2:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">8 % 3</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
2</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">/</span> operator, in contrast to <span class="literal">//</span>, doesn’t do any rounding:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">8 / 2</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
4.0<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">9 / 5</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
1.8<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">-9 / 5</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
-1.8</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">These result values are not integers! They have a decimal point and belong to a different Python type called <em>float</em> (for “floating-point numbers”). You can write float values by including a decimal point:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">12.5 * 2</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
25.0</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">We’ll focus on integers for now and return to floating-point numbers when we solve Cone Volume later in this chapter.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_11"/>When we use multiple operators in an expression, Python uses precedence rules to determine the order that operators are applied. Each operator has a precedence. Just like when we evaluate a mathematical expression on paper, Python performs multiplications and divisions (higher precedence) before additions and subtractions (lower precedence):</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">50 + 10 * 2</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
70</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Again, like on paper, operations inside parentheses have the highest precedence. We can use this to force Python to perform operations in our desired order:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(50 + 10) * 2</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
120</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Programmers often add parentheses even when not technically required. That’s because Python has many operators, as we’ll see, and keeping track of their precedence is error-prone and not something that programmers typically do.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">If you’re wondering whether integer values and float values have methods, just like strings, they do! But they aren’t all that useful. For example, there’s a method that tells us how much of the computer’s memory is taken up by an integer. The bigger the integer, the more memory it requires:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(5).bit_length()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
3<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(100).bit_length()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
7<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(99999).bit_length()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
17</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">We need the parentheses around the integers; otherwise, the dot operator gets confused with a decimal point, and we get a syntax error.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec10">Variables</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">We now know how to write string and numeric values. We’ll also find it valuable to be able to store them so we can access them later. In Word Count, it would be convenient to be able to store the line of words somewhere and then count the number of words.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec11">Assignment Statement</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">A <em>variable</em> is a name that refers to a value. Whenever we later use a variable’s name, it gets substituted by what that variable refers to. To make a variable refer to a value, we use the <em>assignment statement</em>. An assignment statement consists of a variable, an equal sign (<span class="literal">=</span>), and an expression. Python evaluates <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_12"/>the expression and makes the variable refer to the result. Here’s an example assignment statement:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars = 250</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Now, <span class="literal">dollars</span> is substituted by <span class="literal">250</span> whenever we use it:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
250<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars + 10</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
260<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
250</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">A variable refers to only one value at a time. Once we use an assignment statement to make a variable refer to another value, it no longer refers to the old value:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars = 250</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
250<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars = 300</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
300</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">We can have as many variables as we like. Large programs typically use hundreds of variables. Here’s an example of using two variables:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">purchase_price1 = 58</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">purchase_price2 = 9</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">purchase_price1 + purchase_price2</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
67</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that I’ve chosen variable names that give some sense of what they’re storing. These two variables, for example, have to do with the prices of two purchases. Using variable names <span class="literal">p1</span> and <span class="literal">p2</span> would be easier to type, but in a few days we’d probably forget what the names mean!</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">We can make variables refer to strings, too:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">start = 'Monday'</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">end = 'Friday'</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">start</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'Monday'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">end</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'Friday'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_13"/>As with variables that refer to numbers, we can use these in larger expressions:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">start + '-' + end</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'Monday-Friday'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Python variable names should start with a lowercase letter and then can contain additional letters, underscores to separate words, and numbers.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec12">Changing Variable Values</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Suppose we have a variable <span class="literal">dollars</span> that refers to value <span class="literal">250</span>:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars = 250</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Now we want to increase the value so that <span class="literal">dollars</span> refers to 251. This won’t work:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars + 1</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
251</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The result is 251, but that value is gone, not stored anywhere:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
250</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">What we need is an assignment statement that captures the result of <span class="literal">dollars + 1</span>:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars = dollars + 1</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
251<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars = dollars + 1</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">dollars</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
252</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s common for learners to think of the assignment symbol <span class="literal">=</span> as equality. But don’t do that! The assignment statement is a command to make a variable refer to the value of an expression, not a claim that two entities are equal.</p>&#13;&#13;
<div class="sidebar">&#13;&#13;
<p class="sb-title"><strong>CONCEPT CHECK</strong></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="sidebarp">What is the value of <span class="literal">y</span> after the execution of the following code?</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_14"/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x = 37</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">y = x + 2</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">x = 20</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="alphat">A. <span class="literal">39</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="alpha">B. <span class="literal">22</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="alpha">C. <span class="literal">35</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="alpha">D. <span class="literal">20</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="alpha">E. <span class="literal">18</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="sb-noindent1">Answer: A. There’s only one assignment to <span class="literal">y</span>, and it makes <span class="literal">y</span> refer to the value <span class="literal">39</span>. The <span class="literal">x = 20</span> assignment statement changes what <span class="literal">x</span> refers to, from <span class="literal">37</span> to <span class="literal">20</span>, but this has no impact on the value referred to by <span class="literal">y</span>.</p>&#13;&#13;
</div>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec6">Counting the Words Using a Variable</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Let’s take stock of our progress toward solving the Word Count problem:</p>&#13;&#13;
<ul>&#13;&#13;
<li class="noindentt">We know about strings, and we can use a string to store the line of words.</li>&#13;&#13;
<li class="noindentt">We know about the string <span class="literal">count</span> method, which we can use to count the number of spaces in the line of words. That gives us one less than the output value that we need.</li>&#13;&#13;
<li class="noindentt">We know about integers, whose <span class="literal">+</span> operator we can use to add <span class="literal">1</span> to a number.</li>&#13;&#13;
<li class="noindentt">We know about variables and the assignment statement, which help us hold on to values so that we don’t lose them.</li>&#13;&#13;
</ul>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Putting all of this together, we can make a variable refer to a string and then count the number of words:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">line = 'this is a string with a few words'</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">total_words = line.count(' ') + 1</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">total_words</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
8</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">line</span> and <span class="literal">total_words</span> variables aren’t required here; here’s how we could do it without them:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'this is a string with a few words'.count(' ') + 1</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
8</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_15"/>But using variables to capture intermediate results is a good practice for keeping code readable. Once our programs get longer than a few lines, variables will be indispensable.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec7">Reading Input</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">One problem with the code that we’ve written is that it works only on the particular string that we’ve typed in. It tells us that there are eight words in <span class="literal">'this is a string with a few words'</span>, but that’s all it can do. If we want to know how many words are in a different string, we’ll have to replace the current string with a new one. To solve Word Count, though, we need our program to work on <em>any</em> string provided as input to our program.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">To read a line of input, we use the <span class="literal">input</span> function. A <em>function</em> is similar to a method: we call it, perhaps with some arguments, and it returns a value to us. One difference between a method and a function is that a function does not use the dot operator. All information passed to functions is through arguments.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Here’s an example of calling the <span class="literal">input</span> function and then typing some input—in this case, the word <span class="literal">testing</span>:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs"> &gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">input()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">testing</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'testing'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">When you type <span class="literal">input()</span> and press ENTER, you don’t get a <span class="literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> prompt back. Instead, Python waits for you to type something on the keyboard and press ENTER. The <span class="literal">input</span> function then returns the string you typed. As usual, if we don’t store that string anywhere, then it’s lost. Let’s use an assignment statement to store what we type:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">result = input()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">testing</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">result</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'testing'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">result.upper()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'TESTING'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice in the last line that I’ve used the <span class="literal">upper</span> method on the value returned by <span class="literal">input</span>. This is allowed because <span class="literal">input</span> returns a string, and <span class="literal">upper</span> is a string method.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec8">Writing Output</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">You’ve seen that typing expressions at the Python shell causes their values to be displayed:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'abc'</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'abc'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'abc'.upper()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_16"/>&#13;&#13;
'ABC'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">45 + 9</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
54</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">That’s just a convenience provided by the Python shell. It assumes that if you type an expression, then you probably want to see its value. But when running a Python program outside of the Python shell, this convenience is gone. Instead, we must explicitly use the <span class="literal">print</span> function whenever we want to output something. The <span class="literal">print</span> function works from the shell, too:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">print('abc')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
abc<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">print('abc'.upper())</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
ABC<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">print(45 + 9)</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
54</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that strings output by <span class="literal">print</span> don’t have quotes around them. That’s good—we probably don’t want to include quotes when communicating with users of our programs anyway!</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">One nice feature of <span class="literal">print</span> is that you can supply as many arguments as you like, and they all get output with separating spaces:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">print('abc', 45 + 9)</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
abc 54</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec9">Solving the Problem: A Complete Python Program</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">We’re now ready to solve Word Count by writing a complete Python program. Exit the Python shell and you’ll be back at your operating system command prompt.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec13">Launching a Text Editor</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">We’ll use a text editor to write our code. Follow the steps for your operating system.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch01lev3sec1">Windows</h5>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">On Windows, we’ll use Notepad, a bare-bones text editor. At the operating system command prompt, navigate to your <em>programming</em> folder if you’re not already there. Then type <span class="codestrong">notepad word_count.py</span> and press ENTER. Since the <em>word_count.py</em> file doesn’t exist, Notepad will ask you whether you’d like to create a new <em>word_count.py</em> file. Click <strong>Yes</strong> and you’ll be ready to type your Python program.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch01lev3sec2">macOS</h5>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">On macOS, you can use whichever text editor you like. One editor that you likely already have installed is TextEdit. At the operating system command <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_17"/>prompt, navigate to your <em>programming</em> folder if you’re not already there. Then type the following two commands, pressing ENTER after each one:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">$ <span class="codestrong1">touch word_count.py</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
$ <span class="codestrong1">open -a TextEdit word_count.py</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">touch</span> command creates an empty file so that your text editor can open it. Now you’re ready to type your Python program.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h5 class="h5" id="ch01lev3sec3">Linux</h5>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">On Linux, you can use whichever text editor you like. One editor that you likely already have installed is gedit. At the operating system command prompt, navigate to your <em>programming</em> folder if you’re not already there. Then type <span class="codestrong">gedit word_count.py</span> and press ENTER. Now you’re ready to type your Python program.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec14">The Program</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">With your text editor loaded, you can type the code of our Python program. The code is in <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01ex01">Listing 1-1</a>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs"><span class="ent">❶</span> line = input()<br/>&#13;&#13;
<span class="ent">❷</span> total_words = line.count(' ') + 1<br/>&#13;&#13;
<span class="ent">❸</span> print(total_words)</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="ex-caption" id="ch01ex01"><em>Listing 1-1: Solving Word Count</em></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">When entering that code, don’t enter the <span class="ent">❶</span>, <span class="ent">❷</span>, or <span class="ent">❸</span>. Those are there to help us walk through the code and are not part of the code itself.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">We begin by acquiring the line of text from the input and assigning it to a variable <span class="ent">❶</span>. That gives us a string, on which we can use the <span class="literal">count</span> method. We add 1 to the count of spaces to account for the final word in the string, and we use the variable <span class="literal">total_words</span> to refer to that result <span class="ent">❷</span>. The last thing to do is output the value referred to by <span class="literal">total_words</span> <span class="ent">❸</span>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Be sure to save the file once you’ve finished typing the code.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec15">Running the Program</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">To run the program, we’ll use the <span class="literal">python</span> command from our operating system command prompt. As we’ve seen, entering <span class="literal">python</span> by itself runs the Python shell, but we don’t want that this time. Instead, we want to tell Python to run the program in <em>word_count.py</em>. To do that, navigate to your <em>programming</em> folder, and enter <span class="codestrong">python word_count.py</span>. Here and throughout the book, please use the <span class="literal">python3</span> command instead of the <span class="literal">python</span> command if needed.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Your program is now waiting at the <span class="literal">input</span> prompt for you to type something. Type a few words, press ENTER, and you should see our program working correctly. For example, type the following:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">this is my first python program</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_18"/>You should see the program produce <span class="literal">6</span> as the output.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">If instead you see a Python error, go back over the code and make sure you’ve typed it in exactly. Python requires precision. Even a missing parenthesis or single quote will lead to an error.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Don’t be frustrated if it takes you some time to get this program to run. Getting a first program to run can require a lot of work. We have to be able to type a program into a file, invoke Python to run that program, and fix any errors resulting from an incorrect program. But the procedure for running programs doesn’t change, no matter how complex the program, so time you spend here will be well worth it as you work through the rest of the book.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec16">Submitting to the Judge</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Congratulations! I hope it was satisfying to run your first Python program on your computer. But how do we know this program is correct? Does it work for all possible strings? We can test it on a few more strings, but the way we’ll gain even more confidence in the correctness of our code is by submitting it to the online judge. The judge automatically runs a bunch of tests on our code and tells us whether we passed the tests or if something is wrong.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Go to <em><a href="https://dmoj.ca/">https://dmoj.ca/</a></em> and log in. (If you don’t have a DMOJ account, please create one following the instructions in the introduction.) Click <strong>Problems</strong>, and search for the Word Count problem code <span class="literal">dmopc15c7p2</span>. Click the search result to load the problem—it’s called Not a Wall of Text rather than Word Count.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">You should then see the text of the problem, as written by the problem author. Click <strong>Submit Solution</strong>, and paste our code into the text area. Be sure to select Python 3 as the programming language. Finally, click the <strong>Submit</strong> button.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">DMOJ runs tests on our code and shows us the results. For each test case, you’ll see a status code. <em>AC</em> stands for <em>accepted</em> and is what you want to see for each test case. Other codes include <em>WA</em> (<em>wrong answer</em>) and <em>TLE</em> (<em>time limit exceeded</em>). If you see one of these, double-check the code that you pasted, making sure it exactly matches the code from your text editor.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Assuming all test cases are accepted, we should see that our score is 100/100 and that we’ve earned 3 points for our work.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">For each problem, we’ll follow the approach that we used to solve Word Count. First, we’ll explore using the Python shell, learning new Python features as needed. Then, we’ll write a program that solves the problem. We’ll test that program on our computer by supplying our own test cases. Finally, we’ll submit the code to the judge. If any test cases fail, we’ll look over our code again and fix the problem.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3a" id="ch01lev1sec10"><span class="h3aa">Problem #2: Cone Volume</span></h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">In Word Count, we needed to read a string from the input. In this problem, we’ll need to read integers from the input. Doing so requires an extra step to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_19"/>produce an integer from a string. We’ll also learn a little more about doing math in Python.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">This is DMOJ problem <span class="literal">dmopc14c5p1</span>.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec17">The Challenge</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Calculate the volume of a right circular cone.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec18">Input</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">The input consists of two lines of text. The first line contains integer <em>r</em>, the radius of the cone. The second line contains integer <em>h</em>, the height of the cone. Both <em>r</em> and <em>h</em> are between 1 and 100. (That is, the minimum value for <em>r</em> and <em>h</em> is 1, and the maximum value is 100.)</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec19">Output</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Output the volume of the right circular cone with radius <em>r</em> and height <em>h</em>. The formula to calculate the volume is (<em>πr</em><sup>2</sup><em>h</em>)/3.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec11">More Math in Python</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Say we have <span class="literal">r</span> and <span class="literal">h</span> variables referring to a radius and height, respectively:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">r = 4</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">h = 6</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Now we want to evaluate (<em>πr</em><sup>2</sup><em>h</em>)/3. Substituting a radius of <span class="literal">4</span> and height of <span class="literal">6</span>, we have (<em>π</em> * 4<sup>2</sup> * 6)/3. Using a value of <span class="literal">3.14159</span> for <em>π</em>, a calculator gives a result of <span class="literal">100.531</span>. How can we do this in Python?</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec20">Accessing Pi</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">To access the value of <em>π</em>, we’ll use a suitable variable. Here’s an assignment statement to <span class="literal">PI</span> with a lot of accuracy in its value:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">PI = 3.141592653589793</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">This is more a <em>constant</em> than a variable, since we’ll never want to change the value of <span class="literal">PI</span> in our code. It’s Python convention to use uppercase letters for such variables, as I’ve done here.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch01lev2sec21">Exponents</h4>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Looking back at our formula, (<em>πr</em><sup>2</sup><em>h</em>)/3, the only thing we haven’t talked about yet is how to perform the <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> part. Since <em>r</em><sup>2</sup> is the same as <em>r</em> * <em>r</em>, we can use multiplication rather than exponentiation.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_20"/>&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">r</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
4<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">r * r</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
16</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">But it’s more transparent to use exponentiation directly. We always want to write code that’s as clear as possible. Besides, one day you might have to calculate larger exponents, where repeated multiplication becomes increasingly unwieldy. Python’s exponentiation operator is <span class="literal">**</span>:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">r ** 2</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
16</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Here’s the complete formula:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(PI * r ** 2 * h) / 3</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
100.53096491487338</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Great—that’s close to the <span class="literal">100.531</span> result we expected!</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Notice that we’re producing a floating-point number here. As we discussed in “Integer and Floating-Point Numbers” in this chapter, the <span class="literal">/</span> division operator produces a floating-point result.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec12">Converting Between Strings and Integers</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">We’re ultimately going to have to read the radius and height as input. We’ll then use those values to calculate the volume. Let’s give it a try:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">r = input()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">4</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">h = input()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">6</span></p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The <span class="literal">input</span> function always returns a string, even if the user types an integer:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">r</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'4'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">h</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'6'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">The single quotes confirm that these values are strings. Strings cannot be used to perform mathematical calculations. If we try, we get an error:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(PI * r ** 2 * h) / 3</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
Traceback (most recent call last):<br/>&#13;&#13;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;<br/>&#13;&#13;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ** or pow(): 'str' and 'int'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_21"/>A <span class="literal">TypeError</span> is generated when we use values of the wrong type. Python is objecting to us using the <span class="literal">**</span> operator on the string referred to by <span class="literal">r</span> and the integer <span class="literal">2</span>. The <span class="literal">**</span> operator is purely mathematical and has no meaning when used with strings.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">To convert our strings to integers, we can use Python’s <span class="literal">int</span> function:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">r</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'4'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">h</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'6'<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">r = int(r)</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">h = int(h)</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">r</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
4<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">h</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
6</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Now we can once again use these values in our formula:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">(PI * r ** 2 * h) / 3</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
100.53096491487338</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Whenever you have a string whose characters represent an integer, you can use the <span class="literal">int</span> function to convert it to a value whose type is integer. It can cope with leading and trailing spaces, but not non-numeric characters:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">int('  12  ')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
12<br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">int('12x')</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
Traceback (most recent call last):<br/>&#13;&#13;
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;<br/>&#13;&#13;
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '12x'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">When converting a string returned by <span class="literal">input</span> to an integer, we can take it in two steps, first assigning the return value of <span class="literal">input</span> to a variable and then converting that value to an integer:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">num = input()</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">82</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">num = int(num)</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">num</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
82</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Or we can combine the <span class="literal">input</span> and <span class="literal">int</span> calls:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">num = int(input())</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
<span class="codestrong1">82</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">num</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
82</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_22"/>Here, the argument passed to <span class="literal">int</span> is the string returned by <span class="literal">input</span>. The <span class="literal">int</span> function takes this string and returns it as an integer.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">If we ever need to convert the other way, from an integer to a string, we can do that with the <span class="literal">str</span> function:</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="programs">&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">num = 82</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'my number is ' + num</span><br/>&#13;&#13;

&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">str(num)</span><br/>&#13;&#13;

&gt;&gt;&gt; <span class="codestrong1">'my number is ' + str(num)</span><br/>&#13;&#13;
'my number is 82'</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">We can’t concatenate a string and an integer. The <span class="literal">str</span> function returns <span class="literal">'82'</span> from <span class="literal">82</span> so that it can be used in a string concatenation.</p>&#13;&#13;

<p class="indent">We begin by making a variable called <span class="literal">PI</span> refer to an approximation of pi <span class="ent">❶</span>.

<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec14">Summary</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">And we’re off! We’ve just solved our first two problems by writing Python code. We learned about the fundamentals of programming, including values, types, strings, integers, methods, variables, the assignment statement, and input and output.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Once you’re comfortable with this material—perhaps by working on some of the following exercises—it’s on to <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>. There, we’ll learn how our programs can make decisions. We’ll no longer be writing programs that invariably run from top to bottom. They’ll be more flexible, doing what’s needed for the specific problem instance being solved.</p>&#13;&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch01lev1sec15">Chapter Exercises</h3>&#13;&#13;
<p class="noindent">Each chapter ends with some exercises for you to try. I encourage you to complete as many exercises as you can.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">Some exercises may take you a long time. You might get frustrated with repeated Python errors. Like with any skill worth learning, focused practice is needed. When you’re starting to work on an exercise, I recommend solving a few examples by hand. That way you know what the problem is asking and what your program is supposed to do. Otherwise, you might be writing code without a plan, contending both with organizing your thoughts and with writing the program at the same time.</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_24"/>If your code isn’t working, ask: what, precisely, is the behavior that you want? What are the lines of code that are likely culprits for the error that you’re getting? Is there another, perhaps simpler, approach you could try?</p>&#13;&#13;
<p class="indent">I’ve included solutions to the exercises on the book website (<em><a href="https://nostarch.com/learn-code-solving-problems/">https://nostarch.com/learn-code-solving-problems/</a></em>). But don’t peek at those until you’ve given your chosen exercise an honest try. Or two. Or three. If you do look at a solution and learn how one might solve the problem, take a break and then try solving it yourself from scratch. There’s often more than one way to solve a problem. If your solution does the right thing but is different from mine, it doesn’t mean that one of us is wrong. Rather, it serves as an opportunity for you to compare your code to mine, perhaps learning alternate techniques in the process.</p>&#13;&#13;
