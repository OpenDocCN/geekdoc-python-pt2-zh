    this chapter, we’ll discuss how this problem extends beyond accessing individual
    values to the cost of accessing new blocks of data, introducing a new data structure
    to handle this situation.

- en: Computer science is full of instances where accessing data within a block is
    cheap, but retrieving a new block is comparatively expensive. A computer might
    read an entire block of information, known as a *page*, from the hard drive and
    store it in memory. In the days of floppy disk–based video games, you might see
    a message directing you to “Insert disk 5 of 7” or wait while the game loaded
    the next chunk of data from a CD. Similarly, online applications might download
    coherent blocks of data from a server across the internet, allowing you to start
    watching a video before you’ve downloaded the entire thing.

    that computer scientists Rudolf Bayer and Edward McCreight designed to account
    for the cost of retrieving new blocks of data. B-trees store multiple pieces of
    data in a single node, allowing us to pay the expensive retrieval cost exactly
    once to extract all those values. Once the node is in local memory, we can quickly
    access the values within it. The tradeoff is additional complexity when dealing
    with the nodes.

    a massive data set. Consider the index for a literally astronomical data set that
    contains pointers to images of every star, galaxy, nebula, comet, asteroid, and
    other celestial body ever observed. The data set is still larger than the index,
    but the index itself might need to reside across many blocks of slow storage.
    B-trees provide an inventive way of combining the indexing and keys while minimizing
    retrieval costs.

    to storing individual keys. Practically, this means that they allow internal nodes
    many more than two branches, so they’re practically bristling with pointers. They
    also need to store more than a single key in each node. B-tree nodes are packed
    with keys, allowing them to both track multi-way partitions and, more importantly,
    maximize the amount of data we can retrieve by fetching a single node.

    of online shipping. We pay a cost for every box shipped, and these costs can add
    up quickly if we are shipping many small boxes. This is the equivalent of retrieving
    many small tree nodes from expensive storage. If we pack several items into the
    same box, however, we can reduce the cost by shipping them together. Similarly,
    B-trees reduce the cost of retrieving multiple keys by retrieving a block of them
    together.

    provides bounds on how many elements a non-root node can store. All non-root nodes
    store between *k* and 2*k* keys in sorted order. The root node is more flexible
    and is allowed to contain between 0 and 2*k* keys. Like a binary search tree,
    internal nodes use the values of these keys to define the ranges for the branches.
    Internal nodes store pointers for each possible split point, before and after
    each key in the node, allowing for between *k* + 1 and 2*k* + 1 children for all
    internal nodes except the root node, which can have between 0 to 2*k* + 1 children.
    These split points are conceptually the same as what we do in a binary search
    tree—they divide the space into keys that come before the split and keys that
    come after.

    nodes can contain between 2 and 2*k* = 4 items. If we add the key 30 to the subtree

    we may need to use to fix an under-full node, both of which I’ll discuss in this
    section. Each approach relies on augmenting the node’s keys with keys from an
    adjacent sibling. In the first case, we directly merge two small sibling nodes
    into a single node. In the second case, we transfer a key from a larger sibling
    to the under-full node. Which function we use depends on how many keys in total
    the two siblings have. Both of these helper functions are called from the parent
    node with the index for the key that separates the adjacent sibling nodes.

    them, and concatenates them into a single large child node. As such, it requires

    the new child is guaranteed to be valid. [Figure 12-10](#figure12-10) shows this
    procedure, with [Figure 12-10](#figure12-10)(a) depicting a subtree before the

    key in `childL` is less than the separating key, and any key in `childR` is greater

    example. If an index binder contains too few keys, it is a waste of space and

    card. Merging binders consists of taking the cards from one child binder, along
    with the separating card from the parent binder, and putting them in the other
    child binder in the correct order. Since we have already requisitioned the parent
    and one child (and thus have them in local memory), we can do this merge quickly
    with only a single additional requisition for the other child.

    (and potentially children) from its adjacent sibling. This works only when the
    sibling can afford to lose a key and thus applies to cases where the combined
    number of keys of the siblings must be at least 2*k*. While we could merge and
    optimally resplit the adjacent siblings, for illustrative purposes we use a simpler
    approach of transferring only one key. Since we only ever remove a single key
    from a node during deletion or the merge operation, transferring a single key
    is sufficient to fix our under-full node.

    the tree by merging the only two children below the root. [Figure 12-16](#figure12-16)(b)
    shows that after the merge, we are left with an empty root node. Its one key has
    been moved to the merged node. We repair this in [Figure 12-16](#figure12-16)(c)
    by removing the old root node and promoting that node’s single child to be the
    new root node.

    nodes explored during the initial search for the insertion location, deletion
    can modify nodes in other branches. Both merging nodes and transferring keys use
    a sibling node at the same level. However, the total number of nodes modified
    is still limited by the depth of the tree. At most, we access one sibling node
    per level, and the number of nodes accessed scales logarithmically with *N*.

- en: B-trees illustrate a few important concepts. First, they show how we can adapt
    the behavior of previous data structures to handle cases where memory accesses
    between nodes are more expensive than accesses within a node. B-trees combine
    indexing and storage in such a way as minimize the number of accesses we need.
    This is critical for large data sets that might keep information on a disk or
    an external server. By enforcing a minimum of *k* keys for each non-root node,
    we ensure a branching factor of at least *k* + 1 at each node and thus flatten
    out the overall data structure. This helps limit the overall depth of the tree
    and thus the number of retrievals needed for search, insertion, or deletion. We
    also guarantee that each non-root node always remains at least half-full, meaning
    that we do not waste time retrieving nodes with only a few elements (except possibly
    the root).

- en: It is useful to contrast the B-tree’s approach with a more specialized indexing
    scheme for our collectibles. We could develop a data structure that initially
    splits on category. The top-level index maps the collectible’s category, such
    as coffee-related collectibles, to a binder for that specific category. Each category’s
    binder then maps to all the subcategories, such as coffee mugs or coffee posters.
    And so forth. This is also a valid approach that builds off the branching structures
    we have seen throughout this book. The tradeoff becomes one of generalizability
    versus efficiency. In many cases, we can further optimize a data structure to
    a particular task at hand but lose the ability to apply it to other problems.
    In some cases, this tradeoff might be worth it. In others, it might not. Compared
    to a categorical focused indexing scheme, B-trees provide a more general approach
    that can work for any sortable set of keys.

- en: The second concept B-trees illustrate is a second level of dynamism within the
    data structure itself. The B-tree constantly rearranges its structure to adapt
    to the distribution of data it stores and thus remain balanced. As we saw in Chapter
    5, we lose the advantages of the tree-based structure if our tree becomes highly
    unbalanced. B-trees programmatically prevent this through a combination of bounds
    on the number of keys in each node (*k* to 2*k*) and a guarantee that all leaf
    nodes have exactly the same depth. They adapt to “bad” distributions of input
    data by rebalancing—fixing nodes with too many or too few items. While there are
    a wide range of other balancing strategies for trees, B-trees provide a simple
    and clear example of how we can use additional structure (in this case, multiple
    keys per node) to avoid worst-case scenarios.
