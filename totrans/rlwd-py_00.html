<div class="image1"><img src="../images/common.jpg" alt="Image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="noindent">If you’ve learned the basics of coding in Python, you’re ready to write complete programs that take on real-world tasks. In <em>Real-World Python</em>, you’ll write programs to win the moon race with Apollo 8, help Clyde Tombaugh discover Pluto, select landing sites for a Mars rover, locate exoplanets, send super-secret messages to your friends, battle monstrous mutants, save shipwrecked sailors, escape the walking dead, and more, all using the Python programming language. In the process, you’ll apply powerful computer vision, natural language processing, and scientific modules, such as OpenCV, NLTK, <span class="literal">NumPy</span>, <span class="literal">pandas</span>, and <span class="literal">matplotlib</span>, as well as a host of other packages designed to make your computing life easier.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec1"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xx"/><strong>Who Should Read This Book?</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can think of this as a sophomore Python book. It isn’t a tutorial on programming basics but rather a way for you to continue training using a project-based approach. This way, you won’t have to waste your money or shelf space rehashing concepts you’ve already learned. I’ll still explain every step of the projects, and you’ll receive detailed instructions about using the libraries and modules, including how to install them.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">These projects will appeal to anyone who wants to use programming to conduct experiments, test theories, simulate nature, or just have fun. As you work through them, you’ll increase your knowledge of Python libraries and modules and learn handy shortcuts, useful functions, and helpful techniques. Rather than focus on isolated modular code snippets, these projects teach you how to build complete, working programs involving real-world applications, datasets, and issues.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec2"><strong>Why Python?</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Python is a high-level, interpretive, general-purpose programming language. It’s free, highly interactive, and portable across all major platforms and micro- controllers such as the Raspberry Pi. Python supports both functional and object-oriented programming and can interact with code written in many other programming languages, such as C++.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Because Python is accessible to beginners and useful to experts, it has penetrated schools, universities, large corporations, financial institutions, and most, if not all, fields of science. As a result, it’s now the most popular language for machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence applications.</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec3"><strong>What’s in This Book?</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">The following is an overview of the chapters in this book. You don’t have to work through them sequentially, but I’ll explain new modules and techniques more thoroughly when they’re first introduced.</p>&#13;

</div>&#13;
<p class="indent">Each chapter ends with at least one practice or challenge project. You can find solutions to the practice projects in the appendix or online. These aren’t the only solutions, or necessarily the best ones; you may come up with better ones on your own.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxii"/>When it comes to the challenge projects, however, you’re on your own. It’s sink or swim, which is a great way to learn! My hope is that this book motivates you to create new projects, so think of the challenge projects as seeds for the fertile ground of your own imagination.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">You can download all of the book’s code, including solutions to the practice projects, from the book’s website at <em><a href="https://nostarch.com/real-world-python/">https://nostarch.com/real-world-python/</a></em>. You’ll also find the errata sheet there, along with any other updates.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">It’s almost impossible to write a book like this without some initial errors. If you see a problem, please pass it on to the publisher at <em><a href="mailto:errata@nostarch.com">errata@nostarch.com</a></em>. We’ll add any necessary corrections to the errata and include the fix in future printings of the book, and you will gain eternal glory.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec1"><strong><em>Python Version, Platform, and IDE</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">I built all the projects in this book with Python v3.7.2 in a Microsoft Windows 10 environment. If you’re using a different operating system, no problem: I suggest compatible modules for other platforms, where appropriate.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The code examples in this book are from either the Python IDLE text editor or the interactive shell. IDLE stands for <em>integrated development and learning environment</em>. It’s an <em>integrated development environment (IDE)</em> with an <em>L</em> added so that the acronym references Eric Idle of <em>Monty Python</em> fame. The interactive shell, also called the <em>interpreter</em>, is a window that lets you immediately execute commands and test code without needing to create a file.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">IDLE has numerous drawbacks, such as the lack of a line-number column, but it’s free and bundled with Python, so everyone has access to it. You’re welcome to use whichever IDE you want. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Atom, Geany (pronounced “genie”), PyCharm, and Sublime Text. These work with a wide range of operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and Windows. Another IDE, PyScripter, works only with Windows. For an extensive listing of available Python editors and compatible platforms, visit <em><a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors/">https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonEditors/</a></em>.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec2"><strong><em>Installing Python</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">You can choose to install Python directly on your machine or through a distribution. To install directly, find the installation instructions for your operating system at <em><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a></em>. Linux and macOS machines usually come with Python preinstalled, but you may want to upgrade this installation. With each new Python release, some features are added and some are deprecated, so I recommend upgrading if your version predates Python v3.6.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The download button on the Python site (<a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig1">Figure 1</a>) may install 32-bit Python by default.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/FM-fig01.jpg" alt="Image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch00fig1"/>Figure 1: Downloads page for <span class="normal"><a href="http://Python.org">Python.org</a></span>, with the “easy button” for the Windows platform<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiii"/></p>&#13;
<p class="indent">If you want the 64-bit version, scroll down to the listing of specific releases (<a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig2">Figure 2</a>) and click the link with the same version number.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/FM-fig02.jpg" alt="Image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch00fig2"/>Figure 2: Listing of specific releases from the <span class="normal"><a href="http://Python.org">Python.org</a></span> downloads page</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Clicking the specific release will take you to the screen shown in <a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig3">Figure 3</a>. From here, click the 64-bit executable installer, which will launch an installation wizard. Follow the wizard directions and take the default suggestions.</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/FM-fig03.jpg" alt="Image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch00fig3"/>Figure 3: File listing for Python 3.8.2 version on <span class="normal"><a href="http://Python.org">Python.org</a></span></p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxiv"/>Some of the projects in this book call for nonstandard packages that you’ll need to install individually. This isn’t difficult, but you can make things easier by installing a Python distribution that efficiently loads and manages hundreds of Python packages. Think of this as one-stop shopping. The package managers in these distributions will automatically find and download the latest version of a package, including all of its dependencies.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Anaconda is a popular free distribution of Python provided by Continuum Analytics. You can download it from <em><a href="https://www.anaconda.com/">https://www.anaconda.com/</a></em>. Another is Enthought Canopy, though only the basic version is free. You can find it at <em><a href="https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/">https://www.enthought.com/product/canopy/</a></em>. Whether you install Python and its packages individually or through a distribution, you should encounter no problems working through the projects in the book.</p>&#13;
<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec3"><strong><em>Running Python</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">After installation, Python should show up in your operating system’s list of applications. When you launch it, the shell window should appear (shown in the background of <a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig4">Figure 4</a>). You can use this interactive environment to run and test code snippets. But to write larger programs, you’ll use a text editor, which lets you save your code, as shown in <a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig4">Figure 4</a> (foreground).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/FM-fig04.jpg" alt="Image"/></div>&#13;
<p class="figcap"><a id="ch00fig4"/>Figure 4: The native Python shell window (background) and text editor (foreground)</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">To create a new file in the IDLE text editor, click <strong>File</strong>▸<strong>New File</strong>. To open an existing file, click <strong>File</strong>▸<strong>Open</strong> or <strong>File</strong>▸<strong>Recent Files</strong>. From here, you can run your code by clicking <strong>Run</strong>▸<strong>Run Module</strong> or by pressing F5 after clicking in the editor window. Note that your environment may look different from <a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig4">Figure 4</a> if you chose to use a package manager like Anaconda or an IDE like PyCharm.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxv"/>You can also start a Python program by typing the program name in PowerShell or Terminal. You’ll need to be in the directory where your Python program is located. For example, if you didn’t launch the Windows PowerShell from the proper directory, you’ll need to change the directory path using the <span class="literal">cd</span> command (<a href="ch00.xhtml#ch00fig5">Figure 5</a>).</p>&#13;
<div class="image"><img src="../images/FM-fig05.jpg" alt="Image"/></div>&#13;

<h4 class="h4" id="ch00lev2sec4"><strong><em>Using a Virtual Environment</em></strong></h4>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Finally, you may want to install the dependencies for each chapter in a separate virtual environment. In Python, a <em>virtual environment</em> is a self-contained directory tree that includes a Python installation and a number of additional packages. They’re useful when you have multiple versions of Python installed, as some packages may work with one version but break with others. Additionally, it’s possible to have projects that need different versions of the same package. Keeping these installations separate prevents compatibility issues.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">The projects in this book don’t require the use of virtual environments, and if you follow my instructions, you’ll install the required packages system- wide. However, if you do need to isolate the packages from your operating system, consider installing a different virtual environment for each chapter of the book (see <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html#module-venv">https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html#module-venv</a></em> and <em><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html">https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html</a></em>).</p>&#13;
<h3 class="h3" id="ch00lev1sec4"><strong>Onward!</strong></h3>&#13;
<p class="noindent">Many of the projects in this book rely on statistical and scientific concepts that are hundreds of years old but impractical to apply by hand. But with the introduction of the personal computer in 1975, our ability to store, process, and share information has increased by many orders of magnitude.</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">In the 200,000-year history of modern humans, only those of us living in the last 45 years have had the privilege of using this magical device and realizing dreams long out of reach. To quote Shakespeare, “We few. We happy few.”</p>&#13;
<p class="indent">Let’s make the most of the opportunity. In the pages that follow, you’ll easily accomplish tasks that frustrated past geniuses. You’ll scratch the surface of some of the amazing feats we’ve recently achieved. And you might even start to imagine discoveries yet to come.<span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_xxvi"/></p>&#13;
