- en: Congratulations! You’ve worked through this whole book and mastered the *Python
    one-liner* like only a few people ever will. You have built yourself a strong
    foundation that will help you break through the ceiling of your Python coding
    skills. By carefully working through all the Python one-liners, you should be
    able to conquer any single line of Python code you will ever face.

- en: As with any superpower, you must use it wisely. Misuse of one-liners will harm
    your code projects. In this book, I compressed all algorithms into a single line
    of code with the purpose of pushing your code understanding skills to the next
    level. But you should be careful not to *overuse* your skill in your practical
    code projects. Don’t cram everything into a single line of code just to show off
    your one-liner superpower.

    their most complex one-liners? Much like Superman uses his superpowers to help
    normal people live their comfortable lives, you can help normal coders maintain
    their comfortable programmer lives.

- en: This book’s main promise was to make you a master of Python one-liners. If you
    feel that the book delivered on this promise, please give it a vote on your favorite
    book marketplace (such as Amazon) to help others discover it. I also encourage
    you to leave me a note at *[chris@finxter.com](mailto:chris@finxter.com)* if you
    encountered any problem with the book, or wish to provide any positive or negative
    feedback. We would love to improve the book continuously, considering your feedback
    in future editions, so I’ll give away a free copy of my *Coffee Break Python Slicing*
    ebook to anyone who writes in with constructive feedback.

    to my Python newsletter at [*https://blog.finxter.com/subscribe/*](https://blog.finxter.com/subscribe/),
    where I release new educational computer science content such as Python cheat
    sheets almost daily to offer you—and thousands of other ambitious coders—a clear
    path to continuous improvement and, ultimately, mastery in Python.

- en: Now that you’ve mastered the single line of code, you should consider shifting
    your focus to larger code projects. Learn about object-oriented programming and
    project management, and, most importantly, choose your own practical code projects
    to constantly work on. This improves your learning retention, is highly motivating
    and encouraging, creates value in the real world, and is the most realistic form
    of training. Nothing can replace practical experience in terms of learning efficiency.

- en: I encourage my students to spend at least 70 percent of their learning time
    working on practical projects. If you have 100 minutes each day for learning,
    spend 70 minutes working on a practical code project and only 30 minutes reading
    books and working through courses and tutorials. This seems obvious, but most
    people still do this wrong and so never feel quite ready to start working on practical
    code projects.

    the time you invested in this training book. May your investment turn out to be
    a profitable one! I wish you all the best for your coding career and hope that
    we’ll meet again.
