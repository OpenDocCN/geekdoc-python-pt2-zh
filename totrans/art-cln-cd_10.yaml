- en: 'Having studied the complexity conundrum, you may ask: If simplification is
    so powerful, why isn’t everybody doing it? The problem is that implementing simplification,
    despite its great benefits, takes an enormous amount of guts, energy, and willpower.
    Organizations big and small will often firmly resist removing work and simplifying.
    Someone was responsible for implementing, maintaining, and managing these features,
    and they’ll often fight tooth and nail to keep their work even if they know it
    is largely irrelevant. The problem is one of loss aversion—it’s hard to let go
    of anything that provides even the slightest of value. This is something to fight
    against; I’ve never regretted any simplification measure I’ve taken in my life.
    Pretty much everything has value, but it’s important to consider how much you
    pay for the value you get. When I started my Finxter educational site, I consciously
    decided to largely ignore social media, and immediately I started to see notable
    positive results from the additional time I gained to spend on things that move
    the needle. Simplification is beneficial not just to coding but to all areas of
    life; it has the power to make your life more efficient and calmer at the same
    time. Hopefully, by reading this book, you have become more open to simplification,
    reduction, and focus. If you do decide to follow the route of simplification,
    you’ll be in good company: Albert Einstein believed that “a simple and unassuming
    manner of life is best for everyone, best both for the body and the mind.” Henry
    David Thoreau concludes: “Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your
    affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand.” And Confucius knew
    that “Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.”'

    book summary as a Portable Document Format (PDF) that you can download on the
    book’s companion page at [https://blog.finxter.com/simplicity/](https://blog.finxter.com/simplicity/),
    print, and pin to your office wall. Feel free to also sign up for my free *Finxter
    email academy*, which teaches short and simple lessons about programming—we generally
    focus on exciting areas of tech such as Python, data science, blockchain development,
    or machine learning—but we also discuss productivity tips and tricks regarding
    minimalism, freelancing, and business strategy.

    so much time with me. My life goal is to help people get more done through code,
    and I hope this book will help you accomplish that. I hope you have gained insights
    into how you can boost your coding productivity by doing less. And I hope you
    start your first, or next, coding project as soon as you turn this page—and you
    remain active in the Finxter community of like-minded coders. Cheers toward your
    success!
