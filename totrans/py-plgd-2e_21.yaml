    which you can download at [http://www.glfw.org](http://www.glfw.org). On Windows,
    after you install GLFW, set a `GLFW_LIBRARY` environment variable (type **Edit
    Environment Variables** in the search bar) to the full path of the installed *glfw3.dll*
    so that your Python binding for GLFW can find this library. The path will look
    something like *C:\glfw-3.0.4.bin.WIN32\lib-msvc120\glfw3.dll*.

    a single Python file called *glfw.py*. You don’t need to install `pyglfw` because
    it comes with the source code for the book; it’s in the *common* directory. Just
    in case you need to install a more recent version, here is the source: [https://github.com/rougier/pyglfw](https://github.com/rougier/pyglfw).'
