<div class="image1"><img src="../images/common01.jpg" alt="image"/></div>
<p class="noindent">Everyone talks about the heroism and glamour of space travel, but some of it is routine, repetitive work. When you’re cleaning, gardening in the space station greenhouse, or exercising to keep your strength up, you’re following detailed plans designed to keep the team safe and the space station operating. Luckily, robots take care of some of the drudgery, and they never complain about having to repeat themselves.</p>
<p class="indent">Whether you’re programming robots or building games, the loop is one of your basic programming building blocks. A <em>loop</em> is a section of a program that repeats: sometimes it repeats a set number of times, and sometimes it continues until a particular event takes place. Sometimes, you’ll even set a loop to keep going forever. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to use loops to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48"/>repeat instructions a certain number of times in your programs. You’ll use loops, along with your knowledge of lists, to display a map and draw a 3D room image.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev50"><strong>DISPLAYING MAPS WITH LOOPS</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In the <em>Escape</em> game, we’ll use loops extensively. Often, we’ll use them to pull information from a list and perform some action on it.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s start by using loops to display a text map.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev51"><strong>MAKING THE ROOM MAP</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">We’ll make a new map for the example in this chapter and use <code>1</code> to represent a wall and <code>0</code> to represent a floor space. Our room has a wall all the way around the edge and a pillar near the middle. The pillar is the same as a section of wall, so it’s also marked with a 1. I’ve chosen its position so it looks good when we draw a 3D room later in this chapter. The room doesn’t have any other objects, so we won’t use any other numbers at this time.</p>
<p class="indent">In IDLE, open a new Python program, and enter the code in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03list1">Listing 3-1</a>, saving it as <em>listing3-1.py</em>:</p>
<p class="margin"><em>listing3-1.py</em></p>
<pre>room_map = [ [1, 1, 1, 1, 1],<br/>             [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],<br/>             [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],<br/>             [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],<br/>             [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],<br/>             [1, 0, 0, 0, 1],<br/>             [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]<br/>           ]<br/><span class="purple">print</span>(room_map)</pre>
<p class="listing" id="ch03list1"><em>Listing 3-1: Adding the room map data</em></p>
<p class="indent">This program creates a list called <code>room_map</code> that contains seven other lists. Each list starts and ends with square brackets and is separated from the next list with a comma. As you learned in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, the last list doesn’t need a comma after it. Each list represents a row of the map. Run the program by clicking <strong>Run</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>Run Module</strong> and you should see the following in the shell window:</p>
<pre><span class="blue">[[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0,<br/>0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]]</span></pre>
<p class="indent">As you saw in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, printing the map list shows you all the rows run together, which isn’t a useful way to view a map. We’ll use a loop to display the map in a way that is much easier to read.</p>

<p class="notep"><em>Remember to place a colon at the end of the first new line! The program won’t work without it.

<p class="indent">That’s a more useful way to view a map. Now you can easily see that a wall (represented by <code>1</code>s) runs all around the edge. So how does the code work? The <code>for</code> command <span class="ent">➊</span> is the engine here. It’s a loop command that tells Python to repeat a piece of code a certain number of times. <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03list2">Listing 3-2</a> tells Python to repeat the <code>print()</code> instruction for each item in our <code>room_map</code> list <span class="ent">➋</span>. Each item in <code>room_map</code> is a list containing one row of the map, so printing them separately displays our map one row at a time, resulting in this organized display.</p>
<p class="indent">Let’s break down the code in more detail. We use the <code>range()</code> function to create a sequence of numbers. With <code>range(7)</code>, we tell Python to generate a sequence of numbers up to, but not including, 7. Why does it leave out the last number? That’s just how the <code>range()</code> function works! If we give the <code>range()</code> function just one number, Python assumes we want to start counting at <code>0</code>. So <code>range(7)</code> creates the sequence of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50"/>Each time the code repeats, the variable in the <code>for</code> command takes the next item from the sequence. In this case, the <code>y</code> variable takes on the values <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, <code>4</code>, <code>5</code>, and <code>6</code> in turn. This matches the index numbers in <code>room_map</code> perfectly.</p>
<p class="indent">I’ve chosen <code>y</code> as the variable name because we’re using it to represent which map row we want to display, and the row on the map is referred to as the y-coordinate.</p>
<p class="indent">The <code>print(room_map[y])</code> command <span class="ent">➋</span> is indented four spaces, telling Python that this is the chunk of code we want our <code>for</code> loop <span class="ent">➊</span> to repeat.</p>
<p class="indent">The first time through the loop, <code>y</code> has a value of <code>0</code>, so <code>print(room_map[y])</code> prints the first item in <code>room_map</code>, which is a list containing the data for the first row of the map. The second time through, <code>y</code> has a value of <code>1</code>, so <code>print(room_map[y])</code> prints the second row. The code repeats until it’s printed all seven lists inside <code>room_map</code>.</p>

<p class="spara">In an emergency situation on the space station, you might need to issue a distress signal. Write a simple program to print the word <em>Mayday!</em> three times only, using a loop.</p>
<p class="spara1">If you’re stuck, start with <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03list2">Listing 3-2</a>, used for printing the map. You just need to change what the program prints and how many times it loops the print code.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev53"><strong>LOOP THE LOOP</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Our map output is getting better, but it still has a couple of limitations. One is that the commas and brackets make it look cluttered. The other limitation is that we can’t do anything with the individual wall panels or spaces in the room. We’ll need to be able to handle whatever is at each position in the room separately, so we can display its image correctly. To do that, we’ll need to use more loops.</p>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev54"><strong>NESTING LOOPS TO GET ROOM COORDINATES</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">The <em>listing3-2.py</em> program uses a loop to extract each row of the map. Now we need to use another loop to examine each position in the row, so we can access the objects there individually. Doing so will enable us to have full control over how the items are displayed.</p>
<p class="indent">You just saw that we can repeat a piece of code inside a loop. We can also put a loop inside another loop, which is known as a <em>nested loop</em>. To see how this works, we’ll first use this technique to print the coordinates for each space in the room. Edit your code to match <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03list3">Listing 3-3</a>:</p>

</div>
<p class="indent">Save your program as <em>listing3-3.py</em> and run the program by clicking <strong>Run</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>Run Module</strong>. You’ll see the following output:</p>

<p class="indent">The output continues and ends on <code>y= 6 x= 4</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">We’ve set up the <code>y</code> loop the same as before so it repeats seven times <span class="ent">➊</span>, once for each number from <code>0</code> to <code>6</code>, putting that value into the <code>y</code> variable. This is what is different in our program this time: inside the <code>y</code> loop, we start a new <code>for</code> loop that uses the <code>x</code> variable and gives it a <code>range</code> of five values, from <code>0</code> to <code>4</code> <span class="ent">➋</span>. The first time through the <code>y</code> loop, <code>y</code> is <code>0</code>, and <code>x</code> then takes the values <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code> in turn while <code>y</code> is <code>0</code>. The second time through the <code>y</code> loop, <code>y</code> is <code>1</code>. We start a new <code>x</code> loop, and it takes the values <code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code>, and <code>4</code> again while <code>y</code> is <code>1</code>. This looping keeps going until <code>y</code> is <code>6</code> and <code>x</code> is <code>4</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">You can see how the loops work when you look at the program’s output: inside the <code>x</code> loop, we print the values for <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> each time the <code>x</code> loop repeats <span class="ent">➌</span>. When the <code>x</code> loop finishes, we print a blank line <span class="ent">➍</span> before the next repeat of the <code>y</code> loop. We do this by leaving the <code>print()</code> function’s parentheses empty. The blank line breaks up where the <code>y</code> loop repeats, and the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52"/>output shows you what the values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are each time through the inner <code>x</code> loop. As you can see, this program outputs the y- and x-coordinates of every position in the room.</p>
<div class="sidebar1">
<p class="sidebart"><strong>TIP</strong></p>
<p class="spara">We’ve used the variable names <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> in our loops, but those variable names don’t affect the way the program runs. You could call them <code>sausages</code> and <code>eggs</code>, and the program would work just the same. It wouldn’t be as easy to understand, though. Because we’re getting x- and y-coordinates, it makes sense to use <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for our variable names.</p>
</div>
<h4 class="h4" id="lev55"><strong>CLEANING UP THE MAP</strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">We’ll use the coordinates in the loops to print our map without any brackets and commas. Edit your program to change the inner nested loop as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03list4">Listing 3-4</a>:</p>
<p class="margin"><em>listing3-4.py</em></p>

<p class="listing" id="ch03list4"><em>Listing 3-4: Tidying up the map display</em></p>
<p class="indent">Save your program as <em>listing3-4.py</em> and run the program by clicking <strong>Run</strong> <span class="ent">▸</span> <strong>Run Module</strong>. You should see the following in the shell:</p>
<pre><span class="blue">11111</span><br/><span class="blue">10001</span><br/><span class="blue">10101</span><br/><span class="blue">10001</span><br/><span class="blue">10001</span><br/><span class="blue">10001</span><br/><span class="blue">11111</span></pre>
<p class="indent">That map is much cleaner and easier to understand. It works by going through the coordinates in the same way the program in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03list3">Listing 3-3</a> did. It takes each row in turn using the <code>y</code> loop, and then uses the <code>x</code> loop to get each position in that row. This time, instead of printing the coordinates, we look at what is in the <code>room_map</code> at each position, and print that. As you learned in <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">Chapter 2</a>, you can pull any item out of the map using coordinates in the form <code>room_map[y coordinate][x coordinate]</code>.</p>
<p class="indent">The way we’ve formatted the output means the map resembles the room: we put all the numbers from one row together, and only start a new line on the screen when we start a new row of the map (a new repeat of the <code>y</code> loop).</p>
<p class="indent"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53"/>The <code>print()</code> instruction inside the <code>x</code> loop finishes with <code>end=""</code> (with no space between the quote marks) to stop it from starting a new line after each number. Otherwise, by default, the <code>print()</code> function would end each piece of output by adding a code that starts a new line. But instead, we tell it to put nothing (<code>""</code>) at the end. As a result, all the items from one complete run of the <code>x</code> loop (from <code>0</code> to <code>4</code>) appear on the same line.</p>
<p class="indent">After each row is printed, we use an empty <code>print()</code> command to start a new line. Because we indent this command with only four spaces, it belongs to the <code>y</code> loop and is not part of the code that repeats in the <code>x</code> loop. That means it runs only once each time through the <code>y</code> loop, after the <code>x</code> loop has finished printing a row of numbers.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="sidebart" id="ch03sb2"><strong>TRAINING MISSION #2</strong></p>
<p class="spara">The final <code>print()</code> command is indented using four spaces. See what happens when you indent it eight spaces, and then see what happens if you don’t indent it at all. In each case, record how many times it runs and how the indentation changes the output.</p>

<p class="noindent">Now let’s look at how the <em>listing3-5.py</em> program works. Much of the program will be familiar to you from <a href="ch01.xhtml#ch01">Chapters 1</a> and <a href="ch02.xhtml#ch02">2</a>. The <code>WIDTH</code> <span class="ent">➊</span> and <code>HEIGHT</code> <span class="ent">➋</span> variables hold the size of the window, and we use the <code>draw()</code> function to tell Pygame Zero what to draw onscreen <span class="ent">➍</span>. The <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> loops come from <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03list4">Listing 3-4</a> earlier in this chapter and give us coordinates for each space in the room.</p>
<p class="indent">Instead of using numbers in the <code>range()</code> functions to tell Python how many times to repeat our <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> loops, we’re using the new variables <code>room_height</code> and <code>room_width</code>. These variables store the size of our room map and tell Python how many times to repeat the loops. For example, if we changed the <code>room_height</code> variable to 10, the <code>y</code> loop would repeat 10 times and work through 10 rows of the map. The <code>room_width</code> variable controls how many times the <code>x</code> loop repeats in the same way, so we can display wider rooms.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="notet"><strong><span class="notes">RED ALERT</span></strong></p>

<p class="indent">The <em>listing3-5.py</em> program uses two images from the <em>images</em> folder: a floor tile (with the filename <em>floor.png</em>) and a wall pillar (called <em>pillar.png</em>), as shown in <a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig2">Figure 3-2</a>. A <em>PNG (Portable Network Graphics)</em> is a type of image file that Pygame Zero can use. PNG enables parts of the image to be see-through, which is important for our 3D game perspective. Otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to see the background scenery through the gaps in a plant, for example, and the astronaut would look like they had a square halo around them.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-2: The images used to make your first 3D room</em></p>
<p class="indent">Inside the <code>draw()</code> function <span class="ent">➍</span>, we use <code>y</code> and <code>x</code> loops to look at each position in the room map in turn. As you saw earlier, we can find the number at each position in the map by accessing <code>room_map</code><code>[y][x]</code>. In this map, that number will be either <code>1</code> for a wall pillar or <code>0</code> for an empty floor space. Instead of printing the number onscreen, as we did before, we use the number to look up an image of the item in the <code>DEMO_OBJECTS</code> list <span class="ent">➎</span>. That list contains our two images <span class="ent">➌</span>: the floor tile is at index position <code>0</code>, and the wall pillar is at index position <code>1</code>. If the <code>room_map</code> contains a <code>1</code> at the position we’re looking at, for example, we’ll take the item at list index <code>1</code> in the <code>DEMO_OBJECTS</code> list, which is the wall pillar image. We store that image in the variable <code>image_to_draw</code> <span class="ent">➎</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">We then use <code>screen.blit()</code> to draw this image onscreen, giving it the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinate of the pixel on the screen where we want to draw it <span class="ent">➏</span>. This instruction extends over three lines to make it easier to read. The amount of indentation on the second and third lines doesn’t matter, because these lines are surrounded by the <code>screen.blit()</code> parentheses.</p>
<h3 class="h3" id="lev58"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56"/><strong>WORKING OUT WHERE TO DRAW EACH ITEM</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">To figure out where to draw each image that makes up the room, we need to do a calculation at <span class="ent">➏</span>. We’ll look at how that calculation works, but before we do, I’ll explain how the space station was designed. All the images are designed to fit a grid. The units we use for measuring images on a computer are called <em>pixels</em> and are the size of the smallest dot you can see on your screen. We’ll call each square of the grid a <em>tile</em>. Each tile is 30 pixels across the screen and 30 pixels down the screen. It’s the same size as one floor tile. We position objects in terms of tiles, so a chair might be 4 tiles down and 4 tiles across, measured from the top-left corner.</p>
<p class="indent"><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig3">Figure 3-3</a> shows the room we’ve just created with a grid laid on top. Each floor tile and pillar is one tile wide. The pillar is tall, so it covers three tile spaces: the front surface of the wall pillar is two tiles tall, and the top surface of the pillar covers another tile space.</p>

<p class="figcap"><em>Figure 3-3: The tile grid overlaid on your first room</em></p>
<p class="indent">The <code>top_left_x</code> and <code>top_left_y</code> variables store the coordinates at which we want to start drawing the first image of the room in the window. We never change these variables in this chapter. I’ve chosen to start drawing where <code>x</code> is 100 and <code>y</code> is 150 so we have a bit of a border around the room image.</p>
<p class="indent">To work out where to draw a piece of wall or floor, we need to convert our map positions (which range from <code>0</code> to <code>4</code> in the <code>x</code> direction, for example) into pixel positions in the window.</p>
<p class="indent">Each tile space is 30 pixels square, so we multiply the <code>x</code> loop number by <code>30</code> and add it to the <code>top_left_x</code> position to get the x-coordinate for the image. In Python, the <code>*</code> symbol is for multiplication. The <code>top_left_x</code> value is <code>100</code>, so the first image is drawn at <code>100 + (0 * 30)</code>, which is <code>100</code>. The second image is drawn at <code>100 + (1 * 30)</code>, which is <code>130</code>, one tile position to the right of the first. The third image is drawn at <code>100 + (2 * 30)</code>, which is <code>160</code>. These positions ensure that the images sit perfectly side by side.</p>
<p class="indent">The <em>y</em> position is calculated in a similar way. We use <code>top_left_y</code> as the starting position vertically and add <code>y * 30</code> to it to make the images join together precisely. The difference is that we subtract the height of the image we’re drawing, so we ensure that the images align at the same point at the bottom. As a result, tall objects can rise out of a tile space and obscure any scenery or floor tiles behind them, making the room display look three-dimensional. If we didn’t align the images at the bottom, they would all align at the top, which would destroy the 3D effect. The second and third rows of floor tiles would cover up the front surface of the back wall, for example.</p>

<p class="spara">Now that you know how to display a 3D room, try to adjust the map to change the room layout, adding new pillars or floor spaces. You can edit the <code>room_map</code> data to add new rows or columns to the map. Remember to change the <code>room_height</code> and <code>room_width</code> variables too.</p>
<p class="spara1">Perhaps try making a room with more rows and adding a doorway by replacing the 1s used for pillars with 0s. In the final <em>Escape</em> game, each doorway will be three spaces. For best results, design rooms with an odd width and height so you can center the door in the wall.</p>
<p class="spara1"><a href="ch03.xhtml#ch03fig4">Figure 3-4</a> shows a room I designed with a width and height of 9. You can try copying my design if you like. I’ve added a grid to make it easier to work out the data for the <code>room_map</code> list. The wall pillars rise two tiles out of the floor, so the grid shown is 11 tiles high. Look at the bottoms of the pillars, not the tops, to work out where to position them. See the end of the chapter for the code to make this room.</p>

<p class="indent">In the real <em>Escape</em> game, the tall wall pillars will only be used at the edges of the rooms. They can look a bit odd in the middle of the room, especially if they touch the back wall. When we add shadows to the game later in the book, objects in the middle of the room won’t look like they’re floating in space, which is a risk of this way of simulating a 3D perspective.</p>
