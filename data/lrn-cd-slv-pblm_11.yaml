- en: Before you jump into whatever is next, I’d like to take a minute to congratulate
    you on what you’ve accomplished to this point. It’s possible that you hadn’t done
    any programming before picking up this book. Or maybe you had done a little programming
    and wanted to improve your problem-solving ability. Regardless, if you’ve made
    it through the book and spent the necessary time grinding through the exercises,
    you now know how to solve problems using a computer. You learned how to understand
    a problem description, design a solution, and write that solution in code. You
    learned about `if` statements, loops, lists, functions, files, sets, dictionaries,
    complete-search algorithms, and big O analysis. These are the core tools of programming,
    and the tools that you’ll turn to again and again. You can also now call yourself
    a Python programmer!

  zh: 在你进入下一个阶段之前，我想花一分钟祝贺你已经取得的成就。也许在拿起这本书之前你还没有做过任何编程。或者你已经做过一些编程，想要提高自己的问题解决能力。不管怎样，如果你已经通过了这本书，并花了必要的时间完成练习，现在你知道如何使用计算机解决问题了。你学会了如何理解问题描述，设计解决方案，并用代码编写解决方案。你学到了关于`if`语句、循环、列表、函数、文件、集合、字典、完全搜索算法和大O分析的核心工具。这些是编程的核心工具，你将一次又一次地依赖于它们。现在你也可以自称为Python程序员了！

- en: 'Perhaps your next step is to learn another programming language. One of my
    personal favorites is C. Compared to Python, it brings you much closer to what’s
    actually going on inside your computer when programs are running. If you’d like
    to learn C, there’s no better book than *C Programming: A Modern Approach*, 2nd
    edition, by K. N. King (W. W. Norton & Company, 2008). I think you’re well positioned
    to read that book at this point. You might also consider learning a language such
    as C++, Java, Go, or Rust, depending on the types of programs you want to write
    (or simply because of what you’ve heard about these languages).'

  zh: 或许你的下一步是学习另一种编程语言。我个人特别喜欢C语言。与Python相比，它让你更接近程序运行时计算机内部的实际情况。如果你想学习C语言，没有比K.N.
    King的《C程序设计：现代方法》，第二版（W.W. Norton & Company, 2008）更好的书了。我认为你现在已经准备好读这本书了。你还可以考虑学习其他语言，比如C++、Java、Go或Rust，这取决于你想要编写的程序类型（或者只是因为你听说过这些语言的好处）。

    solve other kinds of problems that may or may not have anything to do with computing.
