- en: Before you jump into whatever is next, I’d like to take a minute to congratulate
    you on what you’ve accomplished to this point. It’s possible that you hadn’t done
    any programming before picking up this book. Or maybe you had done a little programming
    and wanted to improve your problem-solving ability. Regardless, if you’ve made
    it through the book and spent the necessary time grinding through the exercises,
    you now know how to solve problems using a computer. You learned how to understand
    a problem description, design a solution, and write that solution in code. You
    learned about if statements, loops, lists, functions, files, sets, dictionaries,
    complete-search algorithms, and big O analysis. These are the core tools of programming,
    and the tools that you’ll turn to again and again. You can also now call yourself
    a Python programmer!

  zh: 在你进入下一个阶段之前，我想花一点时间祝贺你至此所取得的成就。或许你在拿起这本书之前没有做过任何编程。也许你做过一些编程，想提高自己的解题能力。不管怎样，如果你已经完成了本书并花费必要的时间进行练习，那么你现在已经知道如何使用计算机解决问题。你学会了如何理解问题描述、设计解决方案，并将解决方案编写成代码。你了解了
    if 语句、循环、列表、函数、文件、集合、字典、完全搜索算法和大 O 分析。这些都是编程的核心工具，也是你将反复使用的工具。现在，你也可以称自己为 Python
    程序员了！

- en: 'Perhaps your next step is to learn another programming language. One of my
    personal favorites is C. Compared to Python, it brings you much closer to what’s
    actually going on inside your computer when programs are running. If you’d like
    to learn C, there’s no better book than *C Programming: A Modern Approach*, 2nd
    edition, by K. N. King (W. W. Norton & Company, 2008). I think you’re well positioned
    to read that book at this point. You might also consider learning a language such
    as C++, Java, Go, or Rust, depending on the types of programs you want to write
    (or simply because of what you’ve heard about these languages).'

  zh: 或许你接下来的步骤是学习另一种编程语言。我个人的最爱之一是 C。与 Python 相比，C 让你更接近计算机运行程序时内部的实际情况。如果你想学习 C，没有比
    K. N. King 编写的《C 程序设计：现代方法》（第 2 版，W. W. Norton & Company，2008）更好的书了。我认为现在你已经准备好阅读这本书了。你也可以考虑学习
    C++、Java、Go 或 Rust 等语言，具体取决于你想编写的程序类型（或者仅仅是因为你听说过这些语言）。

    solve other kinds of problems that may or may not have anything to do with computing.
