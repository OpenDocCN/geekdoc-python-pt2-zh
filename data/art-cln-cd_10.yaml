- en: You made it through the whole book, and you’ve gained insight into how to practically
    improve your programming skills. You’ve studied the tactics of writing clean and
    simple code and the strategies of successful practitioners. Allow me to wrap this
    book up with a personal note!

  zh: 你已经读完了整本书，并且深入了解了如何在实践中提升编程技能。你学习了编写简洁清晰代码的技巧，以及成功从业者的策略。让我用一段个人的感言来结束这本书吧！
- en: 'Having studied the complexity conundrum, you may ask: If simplification is
    so powerful, why isn’t everybody doing it? The problem is that implementing simplification,
    despite its great benefits, takes an enormous amount of guts, energy, and willpower.
    Organizations big and small will often firmly resist removing work and simplifying.
    Someone was responsible for implementing, maintaining, and managing these features,
    and they’ll often fight tooth and nail to keep their work even if they know it
    is largely irrelevant. The problem is one of loss aversion—it’s hard to let go
    of anything that provides even the slightest of value. This is something to fight
    against; I’ve never regretted any simplification measure I’ve taken in my life.
    Pretty much everything has value, but it’s important to consider how much you
    pay for the value you get. When I started my Finxter educational site, I consciously
    decided to largely ignore social media, and immediately I started to see notable
    positive results from the additional time I gained to spend on things that move
    the needle. Simplification is beneficial not just to coding but to all areas of
    life; it has the power to make your life more efficient and calmer at the same
    time. Hopefully, by reading this book, you have become more open to simplification,
    reduction, and focus. If you do decide to follow the route of simplification,
    you’ll be in good company: Albert Einstein believed that “a simple and unassuming
    manner of life is best for everyone, best both for the body and the mind.” Henry
    David Thoreau concludes: “Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your
    affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand.” And Confucius knew
    that “Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated.”'

  zh: 在研究复杂性难题后，你可能会问：如果简化如此强大，为什么大家都不这么做呢？问题在于，尽管简化有着巨大的好处，实施简化需要大量的勇气、精力和意志力。大大小小的组织常常坚决抵制去除工作和简化流程。曾经有人负责实施、维护和管理这些功能，他们常常会竭力保留自己的工作，即使他们知道这些工作大多是无关紧要的。问题在于损失厌恶——很难放弃任何即使只有一点点价值的东西。这是一个需要抗争的难题；我从未后悔我做过的任何简化措施。几乎所有事物都有价值，但重要的是要考虑你为获得这个价值付出了多少。当我开始我的Finxter教育网站时，我有意决定在很大程度上忽略社交媒体，立刻，我开始看到因多出来的时间而带来的显著正面结果，这些时间我可以用来做那些能推动进展的事。简化不仅对编程有益，对生活的各个领域也同样有益；它有能力让你的生活更加高效和宁静。希望通过阅读这本书，你已经更加开放于简化、减少和专注。如果你决定走简化的道路，你将与伟大的思想家同行：阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦认为：“简单而谦逊的生活方式是最适合每个人的，既有益于身体，又有益于心灵。”亨利·大卫·梭罗总结道：“简朴，简朴，再简朴！我说，让你的事务只有两三件，而不是一百件或一千件。”而孔子知道：“人生其实很简单，但我们非得让它变得复杂。”
- en: To help you with your continuous effort to simplify, I’ve created a one-page
    book summary as a Portable Document Format (PDF) that you can download on the
    book’s companion page at [https://blog.finxter.com/simplicity/](https://blog.finxter.com/simplicity/),
    print, and pin to your office wall. Feel free to also sign up for my free *Finxter
    email academy*, which teaches short and simple lessons about programming—we generally
    focus on exciting areas of tech such as Python, data science, blockchain development,
    or machine learning—but we also discuss productivity tips and tricks regarding
    minimalism, freelancing, and business strategy.

  zh: 为了帮助你持续简化，我创建了一份一页的书籍摘要，格式为便携文档格式（PDF），你可以在本书配套页面[https://blog.finxter.com/simplicity/](https://blog.finxter.com/simplicity/)上下载、打印，并将其钉在办公室墙上。你也可以随时注册我的免费*Finxter邮件学院*，它教授简短而简单的编程课程——我们通常专注于一些激动人心的技术领域，如Python、数据科学、区块链开发或机器学习——但我们也讨论与极简主义、自由职业和商业策略相关的生产力技巧。
- en: Before you leave, please allow me to express my deep gratitude for you spending
    so much time with me. My life goal is to help people get more done through code,
    and I hope this book will help you accomplish that. I hope you have gained insights
    into how you can boost your coding productivity by doing less. And I hope you
    start your first, or next, coding project as soon as you turn this page—and you
    remain active in the Finxter community of like-minded coders. Cheers toward your
    success!
